<h3>
<a name=""situation-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#situation-2""></a>Situation</h3>
<p>I am proposing the funding of a People, Organization and Community Working Group (POC) for 3 months ending on October 1st, 2021.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""what-is-the-core-problems-you-want-to-solve-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#what-is-the-core-problems-you-want-to-solve-3""></a>What is the core problem(s) you want to solve?</h3>
<p>As the Coop grows, our ability to operate efficiently and utilize the skills within our DAO will be challenged.</p>
<p>This will manifest through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disconnect with our <strong>community</strong> and a failure to leverage this group as a motivated, passionate and engaged foundation to champion our products</li>
<li>Inefficiencies within our <strong>organizational</strong> processes which impact our ability to plan, waste time and decrease the effectiveness of Index Coop contributors and Working Groups</li>
<li>Ineffective identification, utilization and retention of top <strong>people</strong> talent will restrict long term growth</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name=""why-is-this-worth-addressing-today-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#why-is-this-worth-addressing-today-4""></a>Why is this worth addressing today?</h3>
<p><strong>People are the most important driver of organizational success.</strong> If Index Coop can recruit the right people, focusing them on the right things and enable them to work in the right way - we will create an environment where we can become a market leading billion dollar DAO.</p>
<p>Recently, the Coop has experienced a period of rapid growth. As such, there is a pressing need to ensure contributors can be engaged and channeled in a way that drives meaningful results.</p>
<p>A dedicated People, Organization and Community (POC) team will help ensure the Coop is made up of <strong>top global talent</strong> working within a <strong>streamlined organization structure</strong>. The POC will act as an <strong>enabler</strong> for the wider Index Coop.</p>
<p><em>For example, we are currently facing a bottleneck with dev resources. Establishing a Community, Organization and People WG could help preempt future bottlenecks and support the identification and recruitment of capability in key strategic areas.</em></p>
<h3>
<a name=""how-will-you-address-it-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#how-will-you-address-it-5""></a>How will you address it?</h3>
<p>There are three interconnected pillars of the POC Working Group. The approach and activity within each of these pillar will evolve, but will likely cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>People</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identification of “People Needs” at the Coop and support filling vacancies to ensure we have the right people in the right jobs (high priority)</strong></li>
<li>Anonymous Owl Pulse survey to identify pain points and opportunities for things we can do differently as a DAO.</li>
<li>Launch of the internship program, establishing Index Coop as a leader in talent development and equal opportunities within DeFi</li>
<li>Design and distribution of payment for Bronze Owls Quest focused on promoting key behaviours</li>
<li>Work with key community members to reimagine “Owl Levels” and the associated benefit packages required to attract and retain top talent. (<a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/trust-and-impact-in-the-index-coop/1661"" class=""inline-onebox"">Trust and impact in the Index Coop <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""4 clicks"">4</span></a>)</li>
<li>Defining and analyzing community health as understanding/measuring community health is essential to establishing long-term strategic vision at the Coop.</li>
<li>Research articles establishing Index Coop as a thought leader in the space on all things DAO community, organization and people</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organization</p>
<ul>
<li>Development of planning and forecasting structures and processes to increase visibility of key milestones and priorities within the Coop</li>
<li>Continuous improvement of our meeting cadence, working rhythm and organizational structure</li>
<li>Index Coop process design and improvement (i.e. treasury process automation)</li>
<li>Explore and maintain operational assets that empower productivity. Improve the effectiveness of our existing collaboration tools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note governance responsibility, such as the handover from Set (i.e. Gov 2.0: <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-gov-2-0-introduction-to-delegated-governance/1733/2"" class=""inline-onebox"">Index Gov 2.0 - Introduction to Delegated Governance - #2 by cedrick <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a>) is not covered within the POC WGs remit.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Community
<ul>
<li>Hosting of weekly community webinars and AMAs content to build an engaged, informed and educated community base</li>
<li>Managing BAU for New joiners call to provide context, knowledge sharing and a sense of community for new contributors</li>
<li>Iteration and streamlining of the WG specific onboarding process to identify and funnel top talent to WGs requiring support</li>
<li>Setting up opportunities for us to connect as individuals and socialize as a community</li>
<li>Moderation of Discord and expanding the functionality offered by this platform (i.e. bot &amp; roles)</li>
<li>Maintenance of internal learning resources and reference guides i.e. the Community Handbook</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name=""what-impact-will-this-project-have-6"" class=""anchor"" href=""#what-impact-will-this-project-have-6""></a>What impact will this project have?</h3>
<p>The POC is here to support all other Working Groups in their attainment of overarching KPIs.</p>
<p>This will be achieved through an engaged community made of high calibre talent working together in an effective way. They will be enabled by an organizational system which supports the identification, planning and accountability of strategic opportunities and objectives.</p>
<p>Thus, the POC will help Index Coop scale up to become a high performing team able to achieve its <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/north-stars-core-kpis-v1/973"">North Stars &amp; Core KPIs</a>.</p>

<h1>
<a name=""situation-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#situation-1""></a>Situation</h1>
<p>We are proposing the creation and Q4 funding of the Governance Operations Working Group [term ending 14th January 2022].</p>
<p>At present, governance operations are fragmented and not centralized into a specific function in the Coop. Operations are executed under the purview of a few individuals and the POC WG mainly, drawing focus from the funded initiatives tied to that WG. There is no holistic monitoring of the process or a clear avenue for iterative improvement or accountability. The desired outcome is providing greater focus and accountability related to governance operations, inspiring a greater sense of execution ease, importance, and protocol ownership. This ensures that contributors responsible for executing governance-related functions are well-trained, accountable and remunerated, providing a clear funding path for governance operations.</p>
<p>It is time to build out the resource-planning, accountability, process-improvement, and reporting functions that a dedicated WG can incentivize and coordinate. Coordinating and executing fair and successful votes, timely reporting, and tracking implementation are essential functions of any operational and autonomous DAO. Given that all executive functions currently flow directly from our governance processes, the importance of ensuring operational continuity in this regard cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>The DeFi Pulse Index also gives the Index Coop access to its underlying components, which are held in its smart contracts. This provides the Coop with Meta Governance power in protocols such as Aave, Compound and Yearn. Therefore, we need to ensure that this process is running smoothly and efficiently by enabling contributors to manage it and make improvements where needed.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>In recognition of the ongoing Index 2.0 discussions and potential near-term impacts on governance operations: This WG, if formed, will defer in whole or part to any resultant organized bodies that may overlap with (or obviate the need for) this WG as envisioned below, or endeavour to supplement and support the Index 2.0 efforts as appropriate. Nonetheless, the WG term is set to the conventional 3-months. A structural / efficacy review will take place within the first two weeks of the final month of the first term to inform a request for renewal or deprecation of the WG as appropriate.</em></p>
<h1>
<a name=""what-is-the-core-problems-you-want-to-solve-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#what-is-the-core-problems-you-want-to-solve-2""></a>What is the core problem(s) you want to solve?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Currently, governance operations and meta-governance operations are done by different people who do not organically coordinate with each other.</li>
<li>Some governance operations tasks are done by just one person, without a fall-back option should that person become unavailable for any reason.</li>
<li>Governance Ops is a vital part of the community. It includes IIP management, setting up Snapshot votes, keeping the community informed on multiple channels, ensuring quality assurance on IIPs, and more. However, most of these tasks are done in isolation which leaves room for efficiency gains and improvements.</li>
<li>Our governance process keeps changing and improving. However, most of it is done by the WG or person that needs to change something (e.g. general IIP template improvements, PWG improving the product IIP template, the meta-governance election process, autonomy group election, etc.). These examples happen organically within the community. However, a Governance Operations working group could support creating such a process, plus maintaining recurring things like the MGC election.</li>
<li>Index Coop is in the midst of rapid growth; with the increased number of contributors joining and the increasing number of working groups, we expect the number of proposals to grow exponentially. Our Meta Governance powers are also increasing day by day. Thus we expect to attract even more outside parties to go through our governance process. This is a time-consuming process for the contributors who currently manage this process, allowing little time to focus on other initiatives. A working group structure would enable us to focus our time and effort solely on ensuring smooth governance operations and reporting and improvement of the process.</li>
<li>Given that passed IIPs generally require that defined action occur, tracking of implementation is currently happening in an ad-hoc manner and generally removed from community awareness.</li>
</ul>
<h1>
<a name=""why-is-this-worth-addressing-today-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#why-is-this-worth-addressing-today-3""></a>Why is this worth addressing today?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Most processes focusing on Governance are already quite established and operated by capable people. This proposal is a means to bring the contributors under one umbrella to increase efficiency, improve coordination and streamline daily operations.</li>
<li>There needs to be an accountability and feedback mechanism for governance operations to inspire greater confidence from token-holders that voting operations are occurring as planned and implementation status is clearly communicated. This creates a problem as contributors who make these proposals have to spend extra time following up on previous IIPs and, as a result, prevents them from focusing on the work at hand (examples <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-73-fli-economic-model-upgrade-past-gas-costs/2355/17"">here</a> and <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-72-redirect-fli-revenue-to-operations-account/2368/14"">here</a>).</li>
<li>The current system of governance operations is executed and funded in an ad-hoc manner that is susceptible to coordination inefficiencies.</li>
<li>The governance process can be made more transparent and accessible.</li>
<li>There is good reporting coming from contributors; however, it is not regular communication that the community can rely on.</li>
<li>As seen in <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-67-delegate-uni-to-flipside-for-community-enabled-analytics/2242"">IIP-67</a> and <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-82-use-indexcoops-aave-holdings-to-list-fei-on-aave-v2/2573"">IIP-82</a>, several third parties wish to use the Index Coop’s Meta Governance powers. But due to the failure of <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-80-meta-governance-proposals-mgp-process/2492"">IIP-80 <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""2 clicks"">2</span></a>, external parties do not have a clear path, orientation, or point of contact when coming to the Coop to request Meta Governance.</li>
<li>There is currently a lack of knowledge around Index Improvement Proposals, with many community members not aware of how to go about the process and, even if they do decide to make a proposal, not sure of the correct steps or format in which to present their proposals and take them to Snapshot. This group can be of support and guide contributors.</li>
</ul>
<h1>
<a name=""how-will-you-address-it-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#how-will-you-address-it-4""></a>How will you address it?</h1>
<p>This proposal, if enacted, would empower the resultant WG to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that governance operations are being attended to in a transparent and accountable manner (i.e. IIP review and editing, Meta-Governance Operations, Snapshot posting and elections).</li>
<li>Provide robust tracking and reporting on governance.</li>
<li>Provide coordinated process improvement recommendations.</li>
<li>Provide risk, failure, and near-miss assessments requested by the community.</li>
<li>Recommend and draft ‘clean-up’ IIPs that fill in gaps or may be required for ongoing DAO operations (i.e. setting advance reminders and facilitating coordination of quarterly funding requests in a timely manner).</li>
<li>Provide feedback and education to community members active in governance re proper procedures and required discussion periods.</li>
</ul>

<p>This WG will aid in fostering the Guiding Principles (<a href=""https://docs.indexcoop.com/our-guiding-principles"" class=""inline-onebox"">Our Guiding Principles - Index Coop Community Handbook <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""2 clicks"">2</span></a>) of:</p>

<li>In keeping with the ‘people-first’ approach of Index Coop</li>
<li>Improved transparency, fairness, communication, organization, autonomy, and accountability</li>

<p>This working group will also create a clear and distinct framework to be followed and carried forward by any contributors who may take up these roles in the future.</p>

<p>The proposed GOWG, if implemented, would be an operations and reporting function within the larger Index Coop organization to facilitate coordination and feedback relating to Governance, Meta-Governance, and Elections.</p>
<p>Over the three month term the GOWG will seek to solve the Core Problems outlined above by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review, coordinate, and execute the governance operations required by passed IIPs and available guidance.</li>
<li>Full ownership of Operations tasks related to the process of creating IIPs as well as Meta Governance votes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the governance process to the extent possible within the current execution guidelines.</li>
<li>Suggest experience-informed improvements to the governance process that may rise to the level of an IIP, as appropriate.</li>
<li>Launching and further development of governance and metagovernance related initiatives (i.e <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/launching-the-index-coop-protocol-ambassador-program/1836"">Protocol Ambassador Program</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outreach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Host a weekly WG meeting (will go to bi-weekly if interest or content is not sufficient to warrant) to review the governance operations and outcomes subsequent to the previous meeting.</li>

<p><strong>Authors: <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/edwardk"">@edwardk</a>, <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/dylan"">@dylan</a></strong></p>
<h3>
<a name=""situation-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#situation-1""></a>Situation</h3>
<p>We are proposing funding for the Engineering Working Group for 3 months ending on December 31st.</p>
<p><strong>What is the core problem(s) you want to solve?</strong></p>
<p>As described in <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/deciding-how-to-prioritize-engineering-work-poll/2685"">Deciding How to Prioritize Engineering Work</a> the in-house engineering team at Index Coop is relatively new. With the launch of DATA in Q3 we’ve proven that we can do most (but not all) of the work to launch a Simple Index product without relying on Set’s engineers. That’s a huge accomplishment! <img src=""https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/clap.png?v=12"" title="":clap:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":clap:"" loading=""lazy""></p>
<p>However, there are many more products that we would like to launch which are much more technically complex. In order to build these effectively, we need better alignment between Set Labs and Index Coop’s Product and Engineering teams. At the same time, we have to get creative and intentional about increasing our in-house engineering ability.</p>
<p>The core problems we want to solve today are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lack of visibility into product priorities, making it difficult to plan engineering work.</li>
<li>Poor coordination between Set Labs and Index Coop when it comes to R&amp;D efforts. This is in part due to Problem <span class=""hashtag"">#1</span>.</li>
<li>There aren’t enough experienced smart contract developers to go around and hiring them has proven difficult.</li>
<li>Lack of documentation, processes, and training infrastructure make it difficult to onboard even skilled developers.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why is this worth addressing today?</strong></p>
<p>The range and quantity of new products we can launch are constrained as much by coordination problems as by limited engineering talent.</p>
<p><strong>How will you address it?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Seeking guidance from PWG for larger R&amp;D efforts, in accordance with expected future launches.</li>
<li>Improving coordination between Set Labs and Index Coop’s engineering teams.</li>
<li>Leveling up existing contributors’ expertise in smart contract programming by investing in mentorship, developer education, pair programming and other means.</li>
<li>Recruiting and onboarding additional engineering talent through our Wizardry channel.</li>
<li>Starting to build Index Coop’s brand in the developer community.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What impact will this project have?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greater in-house financial product smart contract capabilities.</li>
<li>Integrations with at least 4 new protocols (CREAM, Curve, etc.)</li>
<li>Better tools for the community around calculating liquidity requirements and making multisig transactions.</li>
<li>Increased contributor participation in terms of commits to our Github project repositories.</li>
<li>2 additional full-time hires or the equivalent in contributors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Working Group Leader(s)</strong><br>
Co-lead: Edward (<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/edwardk"">@edwardk</a>)<br>
Co-lead:  Dylan (<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/dylan"">@dylan</a>)</p>
<h3>
<a name=""request-for-funding-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#request-for-funding-2""></a>Request for Funding</h3>
<p><strong>Proposed Budget:</strong></p>
<p>$180,000 USD in INDEX ($60,000 per month) and 1,275 INDEX.</p>
<p>This compares to the Q3 budget of $120,000 USD in INDEX which did not include a gas budget.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Funds:</strong></p>
<p>425 INDEX per month for <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/edwardk"">@edwardk</a> as working group co-lead.</p>
<p><a class=""mention"" href=""/u/dylan"">@dylan</a> is a full-time employee of Set Labs and is not included in this budget.</p>
<p>$19,500 in INDEX per month is for full-time contributors <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/0xmodene"">@0xModene</a> and <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/ncitron"">@ncitron</a>. Their compensation packages were passed via <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-66-smart-contract-engineer-offer/2279"">IIP-66 <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""5 clicks"">5</span></a> and <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-75-web3-engineer-full-time-offer/2463"">IIP-75 <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""4 clicks"">4</span></a>.</p>
<p>We also request $45,000 in gas costs for the quarter to deploy new contracts and make transactions. It cost approximately $17,000 in gas to launch DATA, for example. We also need some budget for deploying other contracts (e.g. for OTC 3rd Close), technical operations (contributor rewards, methodologist reward payouts), and testing Web3 functionality on <a href=""http://indexcoop.com"">indexcoop.com</a>. Gas costs are difficult to predict and will depend in part on how many products are launched. It’s quite possible that we are underestimating future gas costs and may need to request additional funding.</p>
<p>The remaining $25,500 in INDEX per month will mainly be used to grow our contributor base. Recent highly talented contributors include <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/flattestwhite"">@Flattestwhite</a>, <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/rootulp"">@rootulp</a>, and <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/blockdev"">@blockdev</a>, among others. We believe that with proper onboarding and incentives in place, contributors will increase their tenure and time allocated to Index Coop, and some will choose to join as full-time contributors.</p>
<p>Other uses of funds may include one-off bounties, recruiting costs, software/services, and smart contract audits (when deemed necessary).</p>

https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/poll-added-proposal-language-operations-working-group-lowg-q4-2021/2858,**POLL ADDED!**Proposal: Language Operations Working Group (LOWG) Q4 2021,https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/poll-added-proposal-language-operations-working-group-lowg-q4-2021/2858,"Oct 4, 2021 7:51 PM","<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p>I am proposing the funding of a Language Operations Working Group (LOWG) for 3 months ending December 31st, 2021. This will be the second iteration of the working group and will address continued and growing interest in Index Coop (IC) products outside English speaking markets through the translation of core content. Contributions in Q4 will also cover immediate operational needs in relation to the new Index Coop website and also support expansion into new markets.</p>
<p><strong>What is the core problem(s) you want to solve?</strong></p>
<p>By facilitating content in several languages the LOWG has grown interest in IC products and supported the efforts of contributors in various regions.</p>
<p>In line with the IC’s <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/growth-north-stars-core-kpis-v1/973"">North Stars and Core KPIs</a>, the LOWG seeks to increase the number of holders of IC products by reaching and communicating with audiences in languages other than English.</p>
<p>The first iteration of the LOWG has helped grow audiences in the key target languages of CN, DE, and ES, as well as several others with promise. Now, with the soon-to-be-released website unifying IC content, there exists an opportunity to further increase engagement and reach because of the visitor-trust and SEO effects of having an authoritative site for our content.</p>
<p>We wish to build on the product knowledge of the group, their demonstrated commitment, and their results to ensure the language facilities of the new site are a great value-add to the customer journey and sales funnel of the IC.</p>
<p>The LOWG also seeks to maintain its open door for newcomers to the IC by having the facility to fund promising opportunities for content in languages that we currently do not serve. To date, we have played a part in supporting the introduction of several now well-established IC contributors, especially in the APAC region.</p>
<p>The LOWG wishes to continue its program of targeted, results focussed activities to serve the growth of the Coop’s North Star’s and KPIs outside of the anglosphere.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this worth addressing today?</strong></p>
<p>It is important to address this problem today because:</p>
<ul>
<li>We should retain and develop the great team already familiar with Coop content,</li>
<li>We have the opportunity to translate present Coop’s successes into new regions,</li>
<li>Strengthening linguistic and regional foundations will create new opportunities,</li>
<li>The Coop should have a go-to team when language expertise is required,</li>
<li>Maintaining a formal structure for translation contributions,</li>
<li>To not work in languages other than English is to leave business on the table and risk trust and credibility</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How will you address it?</strong></p>
<p>This working group will focus on two main initiatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Translating and promoting core IC content in key languages.</li>
<li>Prospecting and nurturing opportunities in other languages as we build audiences around the globe.</li>
</ol>
<p>While the LOWG establishes itself, all contributions are pro-rata.</p>
<p>For the proposed three month period, the LOWG will continue its focus on Chinese (Mainland), German, and Spanish for its key languages. These languages will feature on the new website and fit current Index Coop capacity. Each language will build on last period’s successes:</p>
<p><strong>Chinese</strong>: <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/tudou"">@Tudou</a> has done a phenomenal job of maintaining platforms for IC content (WeChat, Weibo, and Yuque), translating content in a contextually aware manner, and growing impressions - growing blog impressions 518% in the last two months to 3645 and increasing social media impressions 694% to 71,491 over the same two months. Additionally, new contributors have been introduced. Tudou has built on LOWG activities and is now a key part of the APAC IC community and its activities.</p>
<p>Met content targets of 4-12 blogs per month and exceeded 4x impressions target with 7x for social media and 5x for blog.</p>
<p>To maintain blog cadence and 2x impressions target for both social and blog content.</p>
<p><strong>German</strong>: <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/ela"">@ela</a> and <span class=""mention"">@metigoit</span> both contributed to German content over the two-month initial LOWG period. Though held back due to unforeseen circumstances during the first month, DE content and social media has increased impressions and followers and also featured a new-joiner contribution.</p>
<p>Met content targets overall with 9 for the two months from a minimum required of 8. Started a Twitter channel with a follower target of 50. Almost met with 46 - most added in last month.</p>
<p>To target increased rates of blogging and social activity. Targeting 100 Twitter followers in October.</p>
<p><strong>Spanish</strong>: <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/sver"">@sver</a> has followed <span class=""mention"">@cryptotexan</span>’s playbook on Twitter and has more than doubled followers in two months to 107. Tweeting multiple times per day we are now expecting a breakout. Blogs were posted at the maximum of 12 per month for both months.</p>
<p>Targeting full coverage of key IC content and 250 Twitter followers.</p>
<p>The three languages above will report engagement statistics and seek growth in impressions and followers. Longer term, as we move to the unified IC website, there will be efforts to attribute sales and other conversions, such as content engagement.</p>
<p>During the last two months, the LOWG rewarded consistent contributions in <a href=""https://cryptoouf.com/index-coop"">French <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a>, <a href=""https://crypto-sova.blogspot.com/"">Russian</a>, <a href=""https://nakamomo.substack.com/"">Swedish</a>, and Turkish. All met and at least slightly exceeded their blog count target of 4 per month. In the case of the French blog, many more articles were added and they are circulated with a newsletter. For the Turkish content, <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/insidetrader"">@insidetrader</a> moved IC content from his personal blog to a dedicated <a href=""https://indexcooptr.substack.com/"">Index Coop TR substack</a>.</p>
<p>Japanese and Portuguese contributions joined the LOWG during August and September. Both languages are promising in terms of their demographic coverage and crypto involvement. The LOWG will continue support for both. Notably, <span class=""mention"">@larisaldanha</span> has set up a dedicated <a href=""https://lari.substack.com/"">substack </a>and <a href=""https://twitter.com/indexcoopPT"">Twitter for PT</a>. In light of this, Portuguese will be rewarded as an established channel at $1500 per month if the target of 4 blogs a month is met and with an expectation to increase impressions and content engagement.</p>
<p>The LOWG wishes to remain a place for the Coop to find talented and promising DAO contributors. In the previous budget there was little scope for additional funding of contributions. This budget proposal requests funding for 18 blogs in the 3 month period. Recently APAC members have signalled interest in Hindi and there is also Italian as a prospect. It will be the LOWGs task to choose and guide these contributions to evaluate their potential for the Coop.</p>
<p><strong>What impact will this project have?</strong></p>
<p>The LOWG is a supportive group, assisting all other working groups when called upon. Its independence as a discrete working group creates a focused environment for its contributors and acts as a clear point of contact for translation requests.</p>
<p>The LOWG works closely with the Growth Working Group and the Creative and Design Working Group. Often taking its lead from them, the LOWG seeks to further the impact of their work and maximise returns on content without creating additional overhead.</p>
<p>Though currently difficult to attribute, we want to measure the impact of the LOWG by it’s addition to growth and the Coop’s North Star &amp; KPIs. We seek increased content engagement, impressions, and followers across all our channels. We will continue to assess the promise of other languages that currently have Coop content and work to identify where best to expend resources.</p>
<p>As in the last round, key languages (Chinese, German, Spanish) will produce 1 or more IC blogs per week and engage daily on social media. They will deliver statistics relevant to their platforms and channels.</p>
<p>Regular contributors should produce at least 2 pieces of content each month and provide supporting statistics appropriate to their platforms, such as impressions, subscribers, link click-through rates.</p>
<p>The IC should expect to see increased engagement with people from each language worked on by the LOWG. This may manifest as more people in Discord, more attributed purchases, the head of investment at Binance reading our content, or successes such as the group’s members going on to form other groups and business partnerships.</p>

<p><strong>Request for Funding</strong></p>

<p>Note: Social media activity might be covered by impression mining but currently the program is geared to EN content and LOWG contributors are in the early stages of establishing their profiles so some compensation is offered while they gain traction. If a channel transfers to impression mining, it will no longer receive LOWG remuneration for social posts.</p>
<p>By the end of the working group period, we aim to have completed the transfer of key languages to the new site and for the blogs to reside there.</p>
<p><strong>Organization</strong></p>
<p><strong>How will it work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What will you be doing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>How will you interface with the community?</strong></p>
<p>The LOWG will be managed by mrvls_brkfst (myself). Through Q4, I am keen to mentor contributors as well as help with admin and coordination. I will aim to provide more workshops (similar to this <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YXFW1F16hvIyoj6PzGzcclsL3y9QBHAN/view?usp=sharing"">quick SEO workshop</a>) and to find new ways to leverage our content.</p>
<p>Contributors will manage their tasks independently and as they see appropriate for their language. Contributions will be tracked in the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RwnvyzR710EDy8J9l-yXST9v-esuoaYaUkc5N_f4KbU/"">Index Coop Content spreadsheet <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a>. Feedback and reviews will take place. Contributors will be asked to provide statistics relevant to the platforms they use.</p>
<p>Due to time zone challenges, the whole group rarely meets. Communication is via 1:1 calls, chat, and the Discord <a href=""https://discord.gg/6wMcCzPG"">#language-ops channel</a>. Meetings do take place and are recorded for those who cannot attend. Should a weekly meeting become necessary, it will be facilitated.</p>
<p>Direct requests for translation assistance have so far been manageable and requests may continue via the language-ops discord channel or via myself.</p>

<p><strong>The Language Operations Working Group opportunity</strong></p>
<p>I believe the value of communication in a person’s native tongue is essential for understanding and trust. For me, Language-Ops and its contributors exemplify what is possible when people work together. The Index Coop is a magnificent recent creation that embodies the great elemental possibilities offered by the Internet and the Cryptosphere - it is a global coordinated effort to build a better future. The Index Coop is best summed up best in its guiding principles and it is with these principles and thoughts in mind that I will continue working to make the LOWG a valuable asset to the Index Coop.</p>

<p><strong>Authors: <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/edwardk"">@edwardk</a>, <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/dylan"">@dylan</a></strong></p>
<h3>
<a name=""situation-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#situation-1""></a>Situation</h3>
<p>We are proposing funding for the Engineering Working Group for 3 months ending on December 31st.</p>
<p><strong>What is the core problem(s) you want to solve?</strong></p>
<p>As described in <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/deciding-how-to-prioritize-engineering-work-poll/2685"">Deciding How to Prioritize Engineering Work</a> the in-house engineering team at Index Coop is relatively new. With the launch of DATA in Q3 we’ve proven that we can do most (but not all) of the work to launch a Simple Index product without relying on Set’s engineers. That’s a huge accomplishment! <img src=""https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/clap.png?v=12"" title="":clap:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":clap:"" loading=""lazy""></p>
<p>However, there are many more products that we would like to launch which are much more technically complex. In order to build these effectively, we need better alignment between Set Labs and Index Coop’s Product and Engineering teams. At the same time, we have to get creative and intentional about increasing our in-house engineering ability.</p>
<p>The core problems we want to solve today are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lack of visibility into product priorities, making it difficult to plan engineering work.</li>
<li>Poor coordination between Set Labs and Index Coop when it comes to R&amp;D efforts. This is in part due to Problem <span class=""hashtag"">#1</span>.</li>
<li>There aren’t enough experienced smart contract developers to go around and hiring them has proven difficult.</li>
<li>Lack of documentation, processes, and training infrastructure make it difficult to onboard even skilled developers.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why is this worth addressing today?</strong></p>
<p>The range and quantity of new products we can launch are constrained as much by coordination problems as by limited engineering talent.</p>
<p><strong>How will you address it?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Seeking guidance from PWG for larger R&amp;D efforts, in accordance with expected future launches.</li>
<li>Improving coordination between Set Labs and Index Coop’s engineering teams.</li>
<li>Leveling up existing contributors’ expertise in smart contract programming by investing in mentorship, developer education, pair programming and other means.</li>
<li>Recruiting and onboarding additional engineering talent through our Wizardry channel.</li>
<li>Starting to build Index Coop’s brand in the developer community.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What impact will this project have?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greater in-house financial product smart contract capabilities.</li>
<li>Integrations with at least 4 new protocols (CREAM, Curve, etc.)</li>
<li>Better tools for the community around calculating liquidity requirements and making multisig transactions.</li>
<li>Increased contributor participation in terms of commits to our Github project repositories.</li>
<li>2 additional full-time hires or the equivalent in contributors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Working Group Leader(s)</strong><br>
Co-lead: Edward (<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/edwardk"">@edwardk</a>)<br>
Co-lead:  Dylan (<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/dylan"">@dylan</a>)</p>
<h3>
<a name=""request-for-funding-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#request-for-funding-2""></a>Request for Funding</h3>
<p><strong>Proposed Budget:</strong></p>
<p>$180,000 USD in INDEX ($60,000 per month) and 1,275 INDEX.</p>
<p>This compares to the Q3 budget of $120,000 USD in INDEX which did not include a gas budget.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Funds:</strong></p>
<p>425 INDEX per month for <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/edwardk"">@edwardk</a> as working group co-lead.</p>
<p><a class=""mention"" href=""/u/dylan"">@dylan</a> is a full-time employee of Set Labs and is not included in this budget.</p>
<p>$19,500 in INDEX per month is for full-time contributors <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/0xmodene"">@0xModene</a> and <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/ncitron"">@ncitron</a>. Their compensation packages were passed via <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-66-smart-contract-engineer-offer/2279"">IIP-66 <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""5 clicks"">5</span></a> and <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-75-web3-engineer-full-time-offer/2463"">IIP-75 <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""4 clicks"">4</span></a>.</p>
<p>We also request $45,000 in gas costs for the quarter to deploy new contracts and make transactions. It cost approximately $17,000 in gas to launch DATA, for example. We also need some budget for deploying other contracts (e.g. for OTC 3rd Close), technical operations (contributor rewards, methodologist reward payouts), and testing Web3 functionality on <a href=""http://indexcoop.com"">indexcoop.com</a>. Gas costs are difficult to predict and will depend in part on how many products are launched. It’s quite possible that we are underestimating future gas costs and may need to request additional funding.</p>
<p>The remaining $25,500 in INDEX per month will mainly be used to grow our contributor base. Recent highly talented contributors include <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/flattestwhite"">@Flattestwhite</a>, <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/rootulp"">@rootulp</a>, and <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/blockdev"">@blockdev</a>, among others. We believe that with proper onboarding and incentives in place, contributors will increase their tenure and time allocated to Index Coop, and some will choose to join as full-time contributors.</p>
<p>Other uses of funds may include one-off bounties, recruiting costs, software/services, and smart contract audits (when deemed necessary).</p>

https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/launching-a-growth-working-group/602,Launching a Growth Working Group,https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/launching-a-growth-working-group/602,"Dec 22, 2020 10:14 PM","<h2>
<a name=""growth-working-group-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#growth-working-group-1""></a>Growth Working Group</h2>
<p>Lemonade and myself are proposing the creation of a temporary Growth Working Group (GWG), responsible for driving usage of DPI (and any other Index Coop products that may arise). While we propose a temporary working group, we’re in favor of eventually transitioning it into a permanent growth committee.</p>
<p>The GWG will streamline current discussions around growth into a single forum and be responsible for approving, funding, and evaluating growth experiments. The overarching goal of the GWG is to increase AUM by increasing awareness of DPI, driving new customers to DPI, and retaining existing DPI customers.</p>
<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>-The Set team is becoming a blocker for growth and BD initiatives to get done<br>
-We’re currently defaulting to inaction and decision by consensus<br>
-Leaders in the community do not feel enabled<br>
-Need to encourage people taking the initiative and setting up meetings w/o needing the Set Team</p>
<p><strong>Why a temporary committee?</strong></p>
<p>-It lets us move quicker, knowing that nothing here is permanent. It will also make us more informed when we set up a permanent growth committee.<br>
-The structure of the treasury committee, which will ultimately fund the growth committee, is still not finalized and so it seems premature to propose a permanent committee without a defined source of funding.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong></p>
<p>Proposed budget: $100,000 (~20,000 INDEX)</p>
<p>Proposed timeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>First meeting: Jan 5</li>
<li>Initial grants approved: Jan 12</li>
<li>Final meeting: April 5</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name=""gwg-organization-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#gwg-organization-2""></a>GWG Organization</h2>
<p>The GWG will be managed by a council of three members, with one member coming from Set and two from the Index Coop community. The role of council members is to evaluate and prioritize growth experiments over the three months. There will be a council chair, elected by the members, who is responsible for running meetings, but otherwise has no special power.</p>
<p>The GWG will increase AUM by streamlining the process for driving growth initiatives The council will allocate resources to current growth initiatives and solicit new ones from the community.</p>
<p>The council will evaluate all proposals on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Impact: What scale of impact could this experiment have?</li>
<li>Confidence: How confident are we that the experiment will be effective?</li>
<li>Effort: What amount of effort/resources will it take to run this experiment?</li>
<li>Measurable: Are the impacts of this experiment measurable?</li>
</ul>
<p>Every proposal must have a DRI (directly responsible individual) who submits it and takes responsibility for its execution. If the committee is not confident that the quarterback can execute the proposed experiment, they should reject it.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""submitting-a-proposal-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#submitting-a-proposal-3""></a>Submitting a proposal</h2>
<p>Ideas should be submitted to the idea pipeline in the form of a memo which details the idea behind the experiment: hypothesis, resources, time to payoff, how to measure, what part of the funnel will this seek to impact, what level of confidence is there, etc?</p>
<p>Example Memo Template:</p>
<ul>
<li>Idea Name: CoinGecko Ads</li>
<li>Hypothesis: Running ads on Coingecko could generate a high ROI in terms of DPI AUM + volume growth</li>
<li>Idea Description: Contact Goingecko in order to understand rates for an introductory package. Gather creative, optimize targeting if possible. Run ads for set amount of time (2 weeks?). Gather data, evaluate.</li>
<li>Metrics to be Measured: CTR (could we set up tracking analytics?), purchase rate, purchase stickiness vs non-ads buyers (longer term analysis), LTV analysis</li>
<li>Use of funds: $2000 for A/B testing of paid ads, $500 for design help</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name=""growth-dashboard-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#growth-dashboard-4""></a>Growth Dashboard</h2>
<p>Memos will be added to a public Kanban board which organizes growth experiments into various phases based on the prioritization from the council including Unreviewed, Backlog, Queue, Experiments, Analysis, Ongoing, and Discarded.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""gwg-operations-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#gwg-operations-5""></a>GWG Operations</h2>
<p>Every week, the growth council would meet and run through the following process:</p>

</ul>
<h3>
<a name=""experiment-prioritization-8"" class=""anchor"" href=""#experiment-prioritization-8""></a>Experiment Prioritization</h3>
<ul>
<li>The growth council will prioritize experiments based on an ICE Score:
<ul>
<li>Impact: What scale of impact could this experiment have</li>
<li>Confidence: How confident are we that the experiment will be effective</li>
<li>Effort: What amount of effort/resources will it take to run this experiment</li>

</ul>
<h2>
<a name=""use-of-funds-10"" class=""anchor"" href=""#use-of-funds-10""></a>Use of Funds</h2>
<p>The committee is funded with the intention of passing those funds along to growth experiments, and so the vast majority of committee funding is set aside for experiments</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each experiment will have a standard grant size of $2500 to simplify the distribution process. If experiments are showing initial progress and more resources, the committee can allocate up to an additional $7500.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a $1000 reward for each community member that submits a proposal that is chosen. Committee members are not eligible for this reward, but are eligible for GWG grants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The committee is able to spend 10% of funds ($10,000) at its discretion to further its stated goals. All disbursements will be covered in the committee’s monthly report to the committee.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Committee members will not be compensated out of this initial grant. We believe that they should be paid out of the monthly rewards distribution.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""transparency-commitment-11"" class=""anchor"" href=""#transparency-commitment-11""></a>Transparency Commitment</h2>
<p>Each month the treasury will share a report with the community that provides updates including</p>
<ul>
<li>Summary of funds spent</li>
<li>Updates on funded experiments</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name=""faq-12"" class=""anchor"" href=""#faq-12""></a>FAQ</h2>
<ul>
<li>Will GWG committee members create and lead ideas?</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary focus of committee members is on delegating and/or working with regular contributors to see the experiments through. However, they are not excluded from ideating/executing ideas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do the leaders of the GWG need to be incentivized with a fixed income?</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe that the committee members should be paid a fixed income out of the monthly rewards distribution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Should the GWG leaders have a role outside of vetting ideas and distributing capital? (I.E. operational, hosting meetings, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes - The GWG leaders are the quarterbacks here and are responsible for holding people to what they commit to.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""next-steps-13"" class=""anchor"" href=""#next-steps-13""></a>Next Steps</h2>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>In simple terms, Index Coop is an asset management platform with a mission to create widely used crypto structured products. This means that over time, Index Coop will hold a growing number of underlying tokens while managing people’s investments in these tokens.</p>
<p>Just like Vanguard, BlackRock and others, we should aim to provide educational resources and investment insights to investors in our products. Whether it’s a macro piece of research on crypto or an investment thesis for a particular project.</p>
<p>This is a job for an Investment Committee (IC). To analyse and understand the underlying tokens and create investment insights for our investors. This further serves to cement our place in the centre of crypto investing, not just as a product provider, but also as an education and trusted resource.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The role of the IC is to really understand the underlying tokens held in the Index Coop products. Understand their tokenomics, roadmap, governance initiatives, etc. We can think of it as our own internal investment team.</p>
<p>In TradFi, every asset manager has investment analysts, portfolio managers, maybe a CIO and an IC. Published investment research adds to their credibility and helps investors to understand some of the underlying trends and portfolio positions.</p>
<p>I think we need to do the same. There’s an incredible value add opportunity from providing high quality information and research to crypto index investors. Think of it as Messari within the Index Coop.</p>
<p>If approved, the IC would have the following mandate:</p>

<p>GWG I was formed to address inefficiencies in small project funding for growth initiatives. While successes were had in the first iteration, we have identified a number of opportunities for improvement.</p>
<p>The core problem we want to tackle now is: the Coop is not guided by a holistic growth strategy</p>
<h3>
<a name=""gwg-i-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#gwg-i-4""></a>GWG I</h3>
<p><strong>What happened:</strong><br>
-Unincentivized AUM from $9m to $90m<br>
-PoolTogether Program<br>
-Analytics Infra<br>
-Loopring Liquidity Mining<br>
-Research/Content Arm<br>
-AMAs with Exchanges<br>
-Paid programs in motion<br>
-User survey funded<br>
-Bitmart listing</p>
<p><strong>What we liked:</strong><br>
-Bias towards action, quick allocation of funds<br>
-Attempts at reporting transparency<br>
-Venue to get involved<br>
-Growth of unincentivized AUM &amp; supply was strong</p>
<p><strong>What we didn’t like or could do better:</strong><br>
-Too focused on experiment solicitation, not holistically owning growth strategy<br>
-Focused too much on top level metric out of our control (AUM &gt; Impressions)<br>
-Memo solicitation wrong model &gt; needs to skew more top down<br>
-Splitting payments w/ treasury<br>
-More substantial updates from us</p>

<p>Growth is necessary for survival and success of the Coop. Growth means we are successfully continuing our mission of evangelizing and making our products available to customers who can benefit from them.</p>
<p>Without a clear growth strategy, it makes it hard to know what efforts to focus on.</p>

<ul>
<li>Executing the following growth strategy to guide the Coop through at least the end of Q2-21
<ul>
<li>Distilling our core value into the right message</li>
<li>Prioritizing channels to meet our customers where they congregate (en masse)</li>
<li>Making our products widely available when customers decide to buy</li>
<li>Maximizing productive opportunities to assist with retention</li>

<h3>
<a name=""organization-how-will-it-work-9"" class=""anchor"" href=""#organization-how-will-it-work-9""></a>Organization - How will it work?</h3>
<p>The GWG will be managed by a council of four members, with two members coming from Set, and two from the Index Coop community. The role of council members is to prioritize and execute against growth programs which are sourced from members within.</p>
<p>The GWG leaders will have leeway to assign stipends for regular contributors—both full-time and part time—and will have discretionary funds to reward and incentivize activities (I.e. impression mining).</p>
<p>The GWG will continue to use an experiment-based approach with a key difference being that the generation of ideas will be sourced from regular contributors and leaders themselves. With GWG II, there will be little to no reward for idea submissions. Instead, the operating structure will have a heavy focus on rewarding execution of the prioritized initiatives.</p>
<p>GWG Leaders will meet weekly to discuss the progress of initiatives and strategize on how to allocate funds to best serve growth functions. New experiments will be sourced from each leader from conversations around the coop and individual brainstorming.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>In simple terms, Index Coop is an asset management platform with a mission to create widely used crypto structured products. This means that over time, Index Coop will hold a growing number of underlying tokens while managing people’s investments in these tokens.</p>
<p>Just like Vanguard, BlackRock and others, we should aim to provide educational resources and investment insights to investors in our products. Whether it’s a macro piece of research on crypto or an investment thesis for a particular project.</p>
<p>This is a job for an Investment Committee (IC). To analyse and understand the underlying tokens and create investment insights for our investors. This further serves to cement our place in the centre of crypto investing, not just as a product provider, but also as an education and trusted resource.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The role of the IC is to really understand the underlying tokens held in the Index Coop products. Understand their tokenomics, roadmap, governance initiatives, etc. We can think of it as our own internal investment team.</p>
<p>In TradFi, every asset manager has investment analysts, portfolio managers, maybe a CIO and an IC. Published investment research adds to their credibility and helps investors to understand some of the underlying trends and portfolio positions.</p>
<p>I think we need to do the same. There’s an incredible value add opportunity from providing high quality information and research to crypto index investors. Think of it as Messari within the Index Coop.</p>
<p>If approved, the IC would have the following mandate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover and analyse the underlying tokens held in the Index Coop products;</li>
<li>Produce “investment insights” style content for internal and external distribution;</li>
<li>Cultivate relationships with crypto &amp; macro investors to challenge and guide our thinking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Motivation:</strong></p>
<p>Simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>It would be beneficial for the Index Coop to have a group of community members who really understand the underlying tokens. This could help for some of the intrinsic productivity analysis, governance proposals, etc.</li>
<li>Adding high quality “investment insights” content will give us further credibility as a structured products platform and create a sort-of educational moat around Index Coop.</li>
<li>Expanding our contacts and building relationships with crypto investors could lead to positive second-order effects. An example would be <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/lemonadealpha"">@LemonadeAlpha</a> getting the Maker whale to abstain on the governance proposal to add DPI as collateral.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Specification:</strong></p>
<p>At this stage I propose that the IC has 4 members, meeting weekly. Each member will be responsible for covering individual tokens as the primary analyst and producing “investment insights” content for their respective token.</p>
<p>The IC will also seek out industry experts and crypto investors as guest speakers. This will help the IC to form macro views and create macro content, while raising the profile of the Index Coop in the crypto community.</p>

<strong>Date:</strong> May 28, 2021</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: Please see addendum at the bottom for updates to this proposal.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We don’t reach quorum on a majority of meta-governance votes. There appears to be voter fatigue around meta-gov related votes, which are increasing in frequency.</li>
<li>By not engaging in meta-governance for most votes, we are missing an opportunity to further build trust and rapport with the protocols within DPI and build value for Index Coop.</li>
<li>
<strong>UDPATE:</strong> <em>We propose to continue community MetaGov voting as is, and delegate all DPI-related meta-governance votes to a dedicated, elected committee, in case we do not reach quorum on the regular vote.</em>
</li>
<li>This committee will consist of well-informed governors that cast their votes on behalf of Index Coop. This is a change from the current meta-governance process as detailed here: <a href=""https://docs.indexcoop.com/governance/meta-governance"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Meta-Governance <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""6 clicks"">6</span></a>
</li>
<li>Members of the committee are voted in for a 3 month period, with a backstop to recall or replace members in case needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Problem</strong><br>
While the current meta-governance process is not generating major problems, it’s not ideal either. Some issues are highlighted below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>High manual effort</strong> - The current voting process requires a few hours of work from Greg, Cedrick and others, each time a new vote is live or a vote ends. This effort exists, whether we reach quorum or not (which we often don’t). Further, most of the effort is done by the Set team and we see a potential to hand over some tasks to the community.</li>
<li>
<strong>We hardly reach quorum</strong> - An analysis of the most recent meta-governance votes shows a clear picture:</li>

</div></a></div><p></p>
<p><strong>Finding:</strong> Looking at the last 15 votes, we only reached quorum 4 times. That’s only 27%, meaning the Index Coop has <strong>not participated in 73%</strong> of the most recent meta-gov votes.</p>
<p>Often, even when IIPs and meta-gov votes are added to Snapshot at roughly the same time, the meta-gov vote has dramatically lower engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> While we haven’t done a thorough analysis, we can make a few educated guesses.<br>
First of all, the frequency of meta-gov votes has increased quite a bit over the last two months. We can assume that we already witness voter fatigue, as there is a declining voting participation. The voting frequency will only increase more, now that Balancer and Yearn are live and others may come online in the future.</p>
<p>Another reason might be the nature of these votes. Most of them are “house-keeping votes” that are not met with great interest or cause much debate. The only time we saw disagreeing votes was for “Adding renFIL to Aave” and “Add TUSD to COMP”.<br>
Even though most of the votes are “just” housekeeping, it still takes time and brain juice to get properly informed about the Pros and Cons of each vote. Hence, we conclude that meta-governance is becoming less important (or even a burden) for most INDEX holders.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Solution</strong></p>
<p>We propose to form a Meta-Governance Committee (MGC) that is given full delegation of all meta-governance votes. The MGC is inspired by the Spartan Council implemented by Synthetix. The MGC will become a subset of a larger Meta-Governance Working Group (to be proposed separately) to house all meta-gov efforts, including the MGC, the Protocol Ambassador Program, voting operations and execution (to the extent not addressed by this proposal), and further designing, expanding and experimenting with meta-governance at Index Coop.</p>
<p>Below is a break-down of how this committee will be structured:</p>
<ul>
<li>All meta-gov votes held by INDEX holders are delegated fully to this committee</li>
<li>Committee members are voted in by the IC for a 3 month period</li>
<li>It is the MGC’s responsibility to thoroughly review, analyze and execute votes to fulfill Index Coop’s meta-governance duty and privilege</li>
<li>The committee initially will consist of 5 people
<ul>
<li>We want to ensure we reach the right balance of agreement, security and efficiency</li>
<li>This number should hold, even if more protocols are added, as the MGC will be supported by the advice of the protocol ambassadors</li>
<li>The number can be adjusted later if needed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A 3 of 5 majority is required for the MGC to vote on meta-gov proposals
<ul>
<li>Votes will then be executed directly by the Set team or by the committee itself via multi-sig [to be discussed with the Set team]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The committee will adhere to our meta-governance principles
<ul>
<li>These are general guidelines for voting that will be published in a separate forum post</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The committee is supported by the protocol <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/calling-potential-protocol-ambassadors/1485"">ambassadors <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""3 clicks"">3</span></a>
<ul>
<li>Each ambassador is a “protocol-specialist”, ideally with some experience or social capital within the underlying protocol and who is actively keeping up with each protocol’s latest developments</li>
<li>Each protocol ambassador will serve as an advisor to the MGC should there be a vote that isn’t getting clear consensus or needs to be better understood</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each MGC member monitors all new meta-governance votes, each with a focus on a particular protocol(s):
<ul>
<li>The MGC members collectively discuss new proposals and analyze them on their merits and against the meta-governance principles</li>
<li>The MGC connects with the ambassador for that protocol to discuss the vote, if it is non-routine housekeeping or to get a sense of community sentiment</li>
<li>The MGC executes the vote</li>
<li>The MGC reports back to Index Coop as to how the MGC has voted, providing an explanation of the decision in case there was a notable reason to do so</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>INDEX holders can call for any or all MGC members to be replaced at any time via IIP and Snapshot vote as a backstop in the unlikely case of major MGC / Index Coop disagreement</li>
<li>The MGC will report all decisions/votes back to Index Coop in a transparent way (e.g., at minimum, announcing each vote to Index Coop and, for any votes which are more controversial or disagree with the majority, providing an explanation for why MGC voted in the way it did.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Motivation - Why a Meta-Gov Committee</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With all meta-gov votes delegated to the MGC, INDEX holders are relieved from having to participate in the growing number of meta-gov votes, freeing time and energy for other tasks, including voting on IIPs</li>
<li>We believe that this will ensure informed decision-making (which is not solved with lowering quorum or rewarding votes as described above). There are generally no discussion on Discord or the forum regarding live meta-governance votes, so it appears most votes are either (i) cast without much research about the topic, (ii) are obvious, such as with simple housekeeping proposals, or (iii) are not cast, and we don’t reach quorum.</li>
<li>Technical implementation is very simple and fast, as it only requires turning off Snapshot support for meta-governance and delegating the votes to 5 addresses (one multisig, and 2 EOAs)</li>
<li>This solution is a first initiative to solve the current problems, and does not exclude any other ideas from being explored or implemented (e.g. governance mining or staked meta-gov Index)</li>
<li>Consistent, thoughtful and well-informed meta-governance participation is key to building trust with each of the protocols underlying DPI.
<ul>
<li>When it becomes clear that Index Coop is going to show up to each meta-gov vote with the millions of dollars of votes of each protocol held by DPI, and there being a specific group in charge of executing those votes, each protocol will be encouraged to reach out and work with us, especially as DPI grows.</li>
<li>When there are proposals at underlying protocols which bring direct value to Index Coop (e.g., listing of DPI as collateral, etc.), we know that we will be able to adeptly vote DPI’s tokens in support.</li>
<li>This fits within our greater meta-governance framework and is key to building an unforkable moat around our products and DAO.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who is the MGC?</strong></p>
<p>We believe that the MGC should consist of dedicated Index Coop community contributors (silver and gold owls, or people from Set and DFP).</p>
<p>First of all, we want to ensure that votes are cast with the best intent for the IC and the DeFi ecosystem in general. And secondly, while we still rely on specialist knowledge, we want to keep a certain neutrality and prevent too much bias towards one single protocol. This is very important as we do have competing protocols among the underlyings.</p>
<p>Below sets forth our proposed initial make up of the MGC:</p>
<div class=""md-table"">

</tbody>
</table>
</div><p><strong>Rewards</strong></p>
<p>We believe that MGC members should be compensated for their involvement, and will detail rewards if/when this proposal converts to an IIP based on community feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The MGC is our solution for meta-governance as both Index Coop and meta-governance scale. By having the MGC, Index Coop will be able to participate in every meta-governance vote. As a consistent, thoughtful participant in meta-governance with tens of millions of dollars worth of votes per protocol, we will be able to strengthen our ties with each protocol, expand our influence in the DeFi ecosystem, and support those proposals which are most important to Index Coop.</p>
<p>The delegated meta-governance voting committee proposed here is obviously a departure from how Index Coop currently conducts meta-governance, so please provide any feedback or concerns (and apologies for the long post).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE June 7th 2021</strong><br>
After a great discussion in the weekly planning call on Monday and taking into consideration the forum discussion, we recognize that part of the community is not fully comfortable with the approach we proposed in this post. Main concerns are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meta Governance is part of the value proposition of the $INDEX token</li>
<li>Some people like to vote and want to participate</li>
<li>There should be a way to opt-in / -out of delegation to the MGC</li>
</ul>
<p>While we recognize these valid concerns around HOW we solve this, it seems that everybody is aligned with the goal about WHAT we want to achieve: That is, to vote on every meta-governance vote and doing so in an informed way.</p>
<p>Taking into account the inputs from the community, we would like to iterate on the above approach by proposing a new solution, where delegation of voting power only occurs, if quorum is <strong>not</strong> reached via the regular community vote. In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If we reach quorum on a MetaGovernance vote, the vote is executed accordingly (as done today)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If quorum is not reached, however, we propose that the MGC has full discretion to decide on the vote, as described above</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This iteration will ensure that the community keeps its full voting power. And at the same time, this also ensures that the MGC is able to step in on the votes that the community does not care enough to participate. We think that this should strike the right balance between community voting power and IC participation in meta governance.</p>",Index,Lavi,

<h2>
<a name=""owl-levels-and-dsm-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#owl-levels-and-dsm-3""></a>Owl Levels and DSM</h2>
<p>We are also excited to use Season 1 as an opportunity to roll out the Dynamic Staking Model and revised Owl Level structure to contributors outside of Priority Hires.</p>
<p>This process goes hand in hand with the Nest proposal process.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - <em>by 7 Feb</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Within their Season 1 Proposal, Nest Leaders propose the names of Nest contributors and a corresponding “Owl Levels” for each</li>
<li>Each proposal also list a number of “spare” Owl Level slots.</li>
<li>Throughout Season 1, Nest Leaders has the discretion to allocate these “spare” Owl Level slots to new or existing contributors who have gone above and beyond in delivering impact.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - <em>by 18 Feb</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Index Council will review, adjust and approve proposed Owl Levels detailed within each proposal.</li>
<li>They will adjust and confirm both:
<ul>
<li>The specific Owl Levels for named individuals, AND</li>
<li>The number of “spare “ Owl Level slots for each Nest</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>  - <em>by 21 Feb</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Index Council will prepare a “DSM expansion” IIP to provide DSM access to all non-priorty hires</li>
<li>This will contain final details of the DSM parameters for Silver and Bronze Owls, and details on the  revised DSM vest for non-priority hires</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to flag that whilst this process may not be perfect, we are never going to get Owl Levels right the first time. However, the approach proposed provides a simple mechanism to allow us to swiftly move towards a new owl level framework and provide contributors with a robust path to increased ownership.</p>
<p>If you have any feedback on questions on the process, for Owl Levels, please share them here!</p>
<h2>
<a name=""faq-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#faq-4""></a>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Who approves the final budgets?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A: The community has the final approval on the budget via an IIP vote, but the IC will approve individual Nest proposals and combine those proposals into a final comprehensive plan for community vote.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q: How does the community provide feedback on Nest proposals?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A: In parallel, to the full proposal (with budget and owl levels) being shared with the Index Council, individual nest proposals will be posted on the forum for community feedback. These proposals will not include owl levels and budget numbers initially - and will only be updated with these details once final approval from Index Council has been provided. This is to enable the Council to look holistically across the proposals and adjust them accordingly.</li>

<a name=""situation-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#situation-2""></a>Situation</h2>
<p>The Index Coop has grown and evolved dramatically since launching in October 2020.</p>
<p>Part of that evolution included how the Index Coop hires full-time contributors.</p>
<p>Currently, the Coop has 5 “full-time” contributors. They were selected based on the criteria detailed in <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-36-full-time-contributor-retention/1021"">IIP-36 <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""12 clicks"">12</span></a> (Lemonde Alpha, Big Sky), <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/hiring-web3-engineer/2275"">Hiring - Web3 Engineer <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""8 clicks"">8</span></a> (0xmodene), <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/hiring-head-of-analytics/1903"">Hiring - Head of Analytics <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""6 clicks"">6</span></a> (JD Cook), <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-66-smart-contract-engineer-offer/2279"">Hiring - Smart Contract Engineer <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""6 clicks"">6</span></a> (Noah). Continuing to hire full-time contributors is essential if we are to achieve and maintain long-term success (see “Motivation” section below for more). Today, many Working Group Leads and other contributors are not technically “full-time.”</p>
<p>Thus far, we have gone through two iterations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-36-full-time-contributor-retention/1021"">IIP-36 Full-Time Contributor Retention <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""12 clicks"">12</span></a></li>
<li><a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-coop-hiring-guidelines-v1/1665"">Index Coop Hiring Guidelines v1  <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""6 clicks"">6</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Generally speaking, the v1 guidelines were effective. They delegated responsibility to small groups of DRIs, made expectations for the role clear upfront (i.e. <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/hiring-web3-engineer/2275"">Hiring - Web3 Engineer <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""8 clicks"">8</span></a>), and resulted in multiple hires that have helped increase the Coop’s technical autonomy. Each hire was confirmed by Snapshot voting.</p>
<p>However, they were not perfect, especially given the evolution of the Coop. Together as a community, we’re on a never-ending journey of <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/discussion-affirming-our-code-of-conduct-and-guiding-principles/2404"">growth and improvement <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""2 clicks"">2</span></a>. Those v1 guidelines are in desperate need of a refresh with <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-2-0-autonomy-next-steps/2475"">Index 2.0 <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a> in full swing and <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/compensation-community-ownership-next-steps/3000/2"">Compensation &amp; Community Ownership <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""3 clicks"">3</span></a> taking centerstage.</p>
<p>Now, it is time to introduce v2 Hiring Guidelines for discussion.</p>
<p>Once these guidelines receive sufficient buy-in, we hope these allow the Coop to quickly begin a new round of hiring in line with the revised guidelines and the broader changes brought about by <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/compensation-community-ownership-next-steps/3000/2"">Compensation &amp; Ownership <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""3 clicks"">3</span></a>.

<a name=""differences-from-v1-hiring-guidelines-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#differences-from-v1-hiring-guidelines-3""></a>Differences from v1 Hiring Guidelines</h2>
<p>In June 2021, <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-coop-hiring-guidelines-v1/1665"">v1 Hiring Guidelines <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""6 clicks"">6</span></a> were proposed, iterated, adopted, and used to make a few hires.</p>
<p>What is being proposed in this post is less of a teardown of those guidelines and more of a refresh. It is intended to better fit the direction we’re moving in with Index 2.0.</p>
<p>Compared to v1, the core differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Delegation of decision making on roles</strong> - the v1 guidelines delegated decision-making to full-time contributors and a Set representative. This group is no longer best suited for this role. We propose that this decision be delegated to the prospective “Wise Owl” council. If that council fails to form by November 28th, 2021 we recommend forming a “Hiring Team’’ with the same responsibilities described in this post.</li>
<li>
<strong>A holistic view of hiring</strong> - v1 decision making was made on a role by role basis, rather than a strategic view of what multiple roles need prioritization &amp; why. The Coop needs to be more intentional and strategic when it comes to hiring full-time contributors.</li>
<li>
<strong>Equity</strong> - v1 compensation for full-time hires included an equity element. This is proposed to be removed as ownership is covered by “Dynamic Staking Model” which enables the Coop to put equity/ownership on sliding scale (vs. “your in” and “your out”) and offer competitive market salaries fixed in USDC.</li>
<li>
<strong>Hiring approval</strong> - v1 had INDEX token holders ultimately deciding who got hired via IIP &amp; Snapshot voting. This proposal instead puts that decision-making in the hands of the community-elected Wise Owls.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name=""core-principles-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#core-principles-4""></a>Core Principles</h2>
<p>These have been slightly modified from <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-coop-hiring-guidelines-v1/1665"">Hiring Guidelines v1 <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""6 clicks"">6</span></a>.These principles are intended to make clear some fundamental thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Get the right people on the bus</strong>: “When facing chaos and uncertainty, and you cannot possibly predict what’s coming around the corner, your best “strategy” is to have a busload of people who can adapt to and perform brilliantly no matter what comes next.” (<a href=""https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/first-who-then-what.html"">Good to Great <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""2 clicks"">2</span></a>)</p>

In this <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/the-index-coop-is-a-startup/1494"">startup-like environment</a>, we need people who are resourceful in their pursuit of delivering impact for the Coop and are able to crank out a high-volume of high-quality work (<a href=""http://blog.eladgil.com/2011/09/hire-for-ability-to-get-shit-done.html"">Hire For The Ability To Get Shit Done <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a>, <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/relres.html"">Relentlessly Resourceful <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""2 clicks"">2</span></a>).</p>
<p><strong>Commitment &amp; Trust</strong>: We, the Index Coop, should be willing to increase our commitment to contributors who earn trust by delivering impactful outcomes and who embody the <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/discussion-affirming-our-code-of-conduct-and-guiding-principles/2404"">principles <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""2 clicks"">2</span></a> we believe are important to our long-term success.</p>
<p><strong>We earn our people</strong>: We believe the best people are recruited (internally &amp; externally), not bought. Protocols that pay top-of-market will always win salary-optimizing people. We believe the best people want to learn. Winning and retaining these people means creating an environment optimized for growth and learning, and so their long-term career capital. We believe that if we improve Index Coop member’s long-term career capital, we will get the best people (<a href=""https://carta.com/blog/carta-101/"">Carta 101 </a>&amp; <a href=""http://www.theallianceframework.com/"">The Alliance</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Speed &amp; iteration</strong>: Similar to v1, we need to create a good-enough solution out the door that enables us address the major talent retention risks we face while still leaving room for iteration. That said, the goal is that v2 is a longer lasting solution.</p>
<p><strong>The Coop hires to fill high-leverage needs</strong>: There are many ways to fill a need or solve a problem, including: software, process, technology, monthly rewards, and other programs yet to be created. Given those alternative solutions at hand, the Coop should use hiring as a tool to find &amp; retain the right people to address high-leverage needs we can’t otherwise solve (<a href=""https://carta.com/blog/how-to-hire/"">Carta</a>).</p>
<p><strong>​​Fairness</strong>: The Index Coop is a prominent actor with exciting prospects for growth in a highly innovative, and highly competitive, space. We intend to provide full-time contributors with attractive compensation packages, while also ensuring the Coop is set-up to thrive in the long-run. Compensation should be objectively based on skills, capability, and expertise. Full-time contributor compensation should be fair (market) and based on the value/impact they provide to the Coop.</p>
<p>Mutually exclusive: If someone is compensated as a full-time contributor, they will not be compensated separately via separate existing or to-be-created programs (no “double-dip”). This may be moot should other Index 2.0 compensation structures come online.</p>

<a name=""motivation-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#motivation-5""></a>Motivation</h2>
<p><strong>Market Realities</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, the competition for great people is fierce.</p>
<p>Crypto organizations are well-funded and strategic. The Coop must be able to compete with these organizations.</p>
<ul>
<li>These organizations (DAOs, corporations, startups) are flush with cash and are aggressively hiring.</li>
<li>They offer lucrative, full-time packages (salary, equity, benefits) to attract and retain talent.</li>
<li>They are strategic about talent acquisition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good humans with talent are scarce</p>
<ul>
<li>There just aren’t that many people that have deep experience and expertise working in crypto (we are lucky that so many of them are contributing to the Coop today).</li>
<li>For folks that have important expertise outside of crypto and are looking to break in, there just aren’t that many who want to work for a DAO. It is a novel, evolving way to work that isn’t for everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why do we need full-time contributors?</strong></p>
<p>The Coop needs contributors <strong>primarily prioritizing Index Coop</strong> in order to achieve and maintain long-term success.</p>
<p>Here’s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Coop is on a mission to make crypto investing simple, accessible, and safe for everyone. At our heart, we are a tech organization helping create deeply technical products, in addition to creating a lasting organization in a new organizational paradigm.</li>
<li>Many mission-critical functions require dedicated, focused effort over long periods of time. To build the type of organization we all want the Coop to become, we need to hire the right people capable of building and executing these functions as their primary responsibility. This co-exists with other types of contributors who are deeply valued and are also important to long-term success.</li>
<li>Hiring full-time contributors is currently the best known mechanism for aligning people &amp; protocol in pursuit of long-term objectives. Should a better mechanism come along, we should be excited to explore it.</li>
<li>We must avoid a revolving door of contributors in highest-impact areas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What happens if we don’t hire full-time contributors?</strong></p>
<p>Index Coop lasting success will be hard (if not impossible) to achieve.</p>
<ul>
<li>We won’t retain talent - loss of core contributors represents the biggest threat to Index Coop’s long term success.
<ul>
<li>We are conscious that right now the Coop is at risk of losing contributors unless full-time hiring continues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We won’t attract talent - they will go to other crypto organizations that offer full-time packages.</li>
<li>Short-termism will prevail. Long-term success will be hard to achieve</li>
</ul>
<p>The Index Coop needs to be able to hire full-time, long-term committed individuals who focus on developing high-impact areas with an “in it for years” mindset. This is to the benefit of all Index Coop stakeholders.</p>
<p>Such long-term contributors need predictability and commitment in the form of salary. <strong>Other benefits, including equity are covered by other aspects of the compensation model.</strong> The only non-financial benefit which may also be covered within the v2 Hiring Guidelines is for health insurance.</p>

</div></a></div><p></p>
<p>We propose the following v2 hiring process to enable Index Coop to quickly act to address our hiring needs.</p>
<p>The changes we propose as part of <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/compensation-community-ownership-next-steps/3000"">“Compensation &amp; Community Ownership”  <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""30 clicks"">30</span></a>work are multifaceted and comprehensive. Thus, it is important to note rolling out the v2 Hiring Guidelines <strong>is not</strong> necessarily dependent on these other topics. We hope to get community buy in for this proposal, and then immediately look to launch a round of fixed salary hires.</p>
<p>This process relies on two distinct teams with delegated responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wise Owls - Responsible for hiring on behalf of the Coop (prioritization, guiding interview process, determining fair market salary). Should the Wise Owls group fail to form by November 28th, we would then form a “Hiring Group” responsible for the same tasks, unless or until a suitable replacement emerges.</li>
<li>Interview Team - Responsible for interviewing individual candidates.</li>
</ul>
<p>More detail on those two teams follows after this section.</p>
<p><strong>Hiring Process</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this section is to provide clear guidelines for how the Coop hires.</p>
<p>This is the proposed hiring process, it assumes that the “Wise Owls” was properly formed with community buy-in.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""hashtag"">#0</span>) Wise Owl drives conversation on needs:</strong> Ranked order priority of roles to take through the hiring process. This will be done following the principles of openness, transparency, and seeking feedback from key stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""hashtag"">#1</span>) Interview Team formed:</strong> Nominated and formed for a specific role.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""hashtag"">#2</span>) Interview Team scopes role:</strong> Create a hiring scorecard and conduct initial research on a competitive market salary</p>
<p><strong><span class=""hashtag"">#3</span>) Open application:</strong> The hiring scorecard will be shared via the Coop forums (<a href=""https://whothebook.com/smarttools-for-leaders/"">Who <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""2 clicks"">2</span></a>). This forum post should include an application (Google Form or a dedicated tool like <a href=""https://www.lever.co/"">Lever</a>) that applicants will be asked to complete in order to submit their application to the hiring team.</p>
<p>This is intended to both 1) prioritize looking internally first and 2) make the role crystal clear to set all sides up for success.</p>
<p><strong><span class=""hashtag"">#4</span>) Conduct the interview process:</strong> An interview process will be run by the “interview team”. This will remain flexible for v2. Depending on the candidate, it may include the following (<a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZJZbv4J6FZ8Dnb0JuMhJxTnwl-dwqx5xl0s65DE3wO8/edit"">Great CEO Within <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""5 clicks"">5</span></a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Phone screen</li>
<li>Topgrading interview</li>
<li>Focused interviews</li>
<li>Work trial</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class=""hashtag"">#5</span>) Salary offers, negotiation &amp; close:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Interview Team conducts the initial salary negotiation</li>
<li>The Interview Team thens makes a recommendation to the “Wise Owls” on an “go” / “no-go” on a hire with a proposed salary offering.</li>
<li>The “Wise Owls” will then approve the proposed salary offer and/or counter proposal.</li>
<li>Final offer presented to the candidate</li>
<li>If the conditions are approved by both parties, the hiring proposal will be confirmed publically. Final salary offers will no longer need to be approved through the IIP process.</li>
<li>If the hire is approved, proceed to an onboarding process which may include a clear <a href=""http://www.theallianceframework.com/uploads/7/8/2/9/7829688/the_alliance_-_sample_statement_of_alliance_.pdf"">statement of alliance <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""2 clicks"">2</span></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class=""hashtag"">#6</span>) Pass:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If at any point in the hiring process it is determined to not be a fit by either side the process will end.</li>
<li>Alternatives may be discussed (i.e. Working Group, Treasury Rewards, and other payment programs that may exist in the Coop)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Termination</strong></p>
<p>This is a challenging topic to navigate. Letting someone go is a stressful experience for all parties involved, but sometimes it is necessary.</p>
<p>When necessary, here is the proposed process:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Clear expectations:</strong> The Index Coop aims to be transparent in our expectations and measurement of performance. This is the purpose of the scorecard (step <span class=""hashtag"">#3</span>) &amp; statement of alliance (step <span class=""hashtag"">#4</span>).</li>
<li>
<strong>Attempt to resolve:</strong> Any failure to meet these measures will first be discussed by the Wise Owls and other relevant parties</li>
<li>
<strong>Decision:</strong> The decision to terminate will be discussed by the Wise Owls and put into effect by the Finance Nest in the event that performance expectations cannot be met. If the Wise Owl model is discontinued long term, an alternative clearly identified group will fulfill this role.</li>
<li>
<strong>Severance:</strong> There will be a severance package of 2 months salary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any gross violation of our <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/discussion-affirming-our-code-of-conduct-and-guiding-principles/2404"">guiding principles  <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""2 clicks"">2</span></a>will result in immediate termination without severance.</p>
<p><strong>Salary</strong></p>
<p>Salary will be determined based on fair market rates within the industry.</p>
<p>The Interview Team will conduct research on a comparable role the candidate is looking to fill, and base their salary options on this fair market rate.</p>
<p>For example, when recruiting for a head of product, the interview team should research typical salaries offered to a head of product at other web3 organizations.</p>
<p>Further, a note that typically (and in v1) salary and equity are tied together in comp. However, in v2 we are separating these out, and address equity and community ownership through a more holistic approach as defined in the “Dynamic Staking Model”.</p>
<p><strong>Equity and Non Financial Benefits</strong></p>
<p>Once contributors move onto fixed salaries, they will still be eligible to participate in the staking model and non-financial benefits packages offered to all contributors based on Owl Levels. The Owl Level of the fixed salaried high will be fixed for the duration of the year, for the foreseeable future, all fixed salaried hires will be Gold Owls.</p>
<p>If this does not come online by Feb 31st, an alternative equity, ownership and non-financial benefits packages will be proposed instead. Indication of what this will look like will be made during the salary offer, negotiation and close phase.</p>
<p>All fixed salaried hires will be awarded benefits aligned to their given Owl Level. Further negotiation on benefits may be conducted if required.</p>
<p><strong>Salary recalibration</strong></p>
<p>Owl Levels can change and are not tied directly to a salary. Every 6 months, Priority Hires are expected to go through a salary recalibration conversation where salary may be readjusted.</p>
<p>The Wise Owls also has the right to immediately kick off a recalibration of an individual’s salary if their current involvement with Index Coop has changed.</p>

<p>Similar to v1, we recommend delegating this decision making to a small group of people. However, to update this for v2, we recommend the creation and usage of the “Wise Owls” group.</p>
<p>Upon formation, the group would be responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring the v2 hiring process guidelines are maintained for all prospective fixed salary hires</li>
<li>Determining which roles to prioritize and articulating why. This will depend on the strategic importance of filling the role.</li>
<li>Negotiating and determining and approving a final salary offer for those going through the fixed salary hiring process.</li>
<li>Considering salary recalibration as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>*Given the ongoing Index 2.0 work, it is critical to note that the responsibilities delegated to the “Wise Owls” is <strong>intended to be iterative</strong>. We have seen success with delegated decision making both with hiring and elsewhere (MGC, FLI parameters, etc…), and we are trying to continue it here.</p>
<p>This post refers to the dedicated “Wise owls” post for how that group forms and other details.</p>

<a name=""who-runs-interviews-interview-teams-8"" class=""anchor"" href=""#who-runs-interviews-interview-teams-8""></a>Who runs interviews? Interview Team(s)</h2>
<p>When interviewing candidates, it is important the composition of the interview team has relevant expertise in the given field.</p>
<p>Thus the responsibility for practically coordinating the interviews and making a recommended salary proposal will lie with an “[role_name] Hiring Team”</p>
<p>This will be comprised of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Member of the Hiring Team</li>
<li>Subject matter experts</li>
<li>Other relevant individuals</li>
</ol>
<p>Other members of the Coop may be asked to attend a discussion with the candidate and hiring team, and/or the hiring team.</p>
<p>The interview term will then make a recommendation to the “Hiring &amp; Owl Levels” on an “go” / “no-go” on a fixed salary hire with a proposed salary offering.</p>
<p>The “Hiring &amp; Owl Levels” will then approve the proposed salary offer and/or counter-proposal.</p>

<h2>
<a name=""foreword-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#foreword-1""></a>Foreword</h2>
<p>We’d like to acknowledge the great work of <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/pepperoni_joe"">@pepperoni_joe</a> and the many others who have been blazing a trail with <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-2-0-leadership-governance-and-decision-making-pods-nest-and-wise-owls/3214"">Index 2.0 | Leadership, Governance, and Decision Making <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""7 clicks"">7</span></a>. We believe that their efforts will make cross-functional decisions like the one this IIP aims to address a whole lot easier in the future. This IIP should be viewed as independent but wholly compatible with the Index 2.0 vision.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""summary-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#summary-2""></a>Summary</h2>
<p>Index Coop’s mission is to make crypto investing simple, safe, and accessible for everyone. Product growth is a core pillar to achieving that mission. Without sufficient liquidity, our index products are less compelling to customers and product adoption is hindered. This slows our growth as a business and the negative effects only compound over time.</p>
<p>There have been many discussions on how to improve liquidity for our products, as well as the INDEX token. These conversations have tended to focus on how to improve liquidity for a specific product in a specific way. Despite good intentions and lots of trying, we’ve been unable to move quickly to solve our liquidity problems, as there is no clear authority or mechanism except IIPs for each suggested strategy.</p>
<p><strong>We propose that the community grant broad executive power to a group of owls to manage liquidity for all products and the INDEX token</strong>. The specific goals they set and how they go about achieving those goals should not have to go to IIP every time they want to take action.</p>

<p>As of Nov. 19, 2021, the approximate USD trade size on <a href=""http://1inch.exchange"">1inch.exchange</a> for 1% slippage on Index Coop tokens are:</p>
<div class=""md-table"">

</div><p><em>Note: 1% slippage includes fees to liquidity providers which is typically 0.3%. Liquidity can change significantly from day to day.</em></p>
<p>We can see from the table above that some of our products suffer from illiquid markets. Users are facing significant slippage, and anecdotally choosing not to invest rather than start their position at a loss. This is made worse by the high gas costs on mainnet. Some of our products can be found on Polygon, but there’s not enough liquidity available to make it a viable alternative.</p>
<p>Liquidity also comes into play when we launch new products. Having initial liquidity is important for getting early adopters. It’s a chicken and egg problem. If we don’t have liquidity on new products, no one will want to trade. And if no one is trading, then there are no fees to attract liquidity providers.</p>

<p>The toolbox for managing liquidity is expanding rapidly as DeFi matures. While this should be a good thing, too many choices are leading to analysis paralysis. This is magnified when trying to reach consensus among a large group of stakeholders.</p>
<p>It’s clear that we need a better process for making liquidity decisions and that process should favor decisiveness and action. The clearest way to do this is through delegated responsibility to a Liquidity Pod.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""scope-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#scope-5""></a>Scope</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pod will have the ability to draw funds as needed from the <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-99-update-operations-account-multi-sig-2/3044"">Operations Account Multi-Sig <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""2 clicks"">2</span></a>
<ul>
<li>Precise funding amount will be determined as part of a broader budgeting process</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pod will set liquidity goals for new and existing products</li>
<li>Pod will decide the best way to reach those goals</li>
<li>Pod will execute the transactions, deploy rewards contracts etc.</li>
<li>Pod will make a liquidity performance dashboard available, and log decisions</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name=""who-will-be-in-the-liquidity-pod-6"" class=""anchor"" href=""#who-will-be-in-the-liquidity-pod-6""></a>Who will be in the Liquidity Pod?</h2>
<p>It’s important that the pod is a cross-functional team. Making quality decisions around liquidity requires an analytical skill set and a high degree of specialized knowledge. It also requires balancing growth with financial discipline. Members of the following working groups will be included in the decision-making process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analytics</li>
<li>Growth</li>
<li>Product</li>
<li>Engineering</li>
<li>Finance</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside of the pod, decisions could be made using the RAPID framework. An example RAPID could consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analytics will <strong>Recommend</strong>
</li>
<li>Growth will <strong>Agree</strong>
</li>
<li>Engineering and Operations Multi-Sig signers will <strong>Perform</strong>
</li>
<li>Finance and Methodologists will provide <strong>Input</strong>

<li>Product will <strong>Decide</strong>

<h2>
<a name=""closing-remarks-7"" class=""anchor"" href=""#closing-remarks-7""></a>Closing Remarks</h2>
<p>We have the expertise within Index Coop to manage liquidity, but without a clear delegation and decision-making framework, spirited discussions often result in no action. We want our experts to be able to work through options, run experiments, and get results without the friction of going through the IIP process.

<p>This proposal identifies and details the Primary Objectives, Projects, and success metrics for Community Nest in Season 1. This proposal has also been shared with the Index Council and Finance Nest and the feedback provided by these groups has been reflected in this proposal.</p>
<p>Community Nest exists to support Index Coop to maximise the value of its people. This can be broadly split into two buckets.</p>

<p>We will be pivoting our contributor strategy to be laser focused on identifying, filling and retaining high impact contributors, while ensuring they have the best tools and processes to effectively coordinate and deliver results.</p>
<p>In addition to this, we will be aggressively experimenting with community led growth strategies to create and grow an engaged and passionate community around Index Coop products. Up until now, the Coop has invested very little in non-contributor community growth.</p>
<p>The product can be forked; People and Community cannot.</p>

<a name=""talent-pod-6"" class=""anchor"" href=""#talent-pod-6""></a>Talent Pod</h2>
<p>The primary objective of the Talent Pod is to ensure we get the right people in the Coop to enable us to become a successful, multi-billion dollar protocol.</p>
<p>The Talent Pod will be looking to gain a deep understanding of the role gaps we currently have by working closely with both the Index Council and each of the Nests. In Season 1, we anticipate these role gaps to be heavily oriented around technical, product-focused roles.</p>
<p>Within Community Nest, while we still believe it is important for us to leverage the Coop’s reputation as one of the industry’s leading DAOs, we will be shifting our recruitment efforts to focus on quality and suitability over quantity.</p>
<p>Working in tandem with Community Pod, our new joiner call will be disbanded and this regular engagement event will be refocused towards education around our product value proposition for new community members.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Build our Technical Talent Pathway</strong> <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/bradwmorris"">@bradwmorris</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Coop needs more technical expertise and Smart Contract capability. The Talent Pod will work closely with Product Nest and Set to identify and coordinate the recruitment of technical roles.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Implement a Repeatable Recruitment Policy (internal job listing/ + external job board)</strong> <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/lfeld"">@Lfeld</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Broader than just for Technical Talent, we will design a framework that can be repeatedly used to proactively identify, vet and onboard contributors into key roles. This will include liaising with relevant internal stakeholders to develop a job listing which will be first presented internally, then to external partners and relevant high visibility job listing platforms. The Talent Pod will proactively engage potential new contributors and manage the end-to-end recruitment process</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Onboarding platform V3</strong> <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/stepvhenh"">@StepvhenH</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our current DAO onboarding is widely recognised as industry-leading. Our new V3 onboarding flow will serve the dual purpose of driving product adoption by educating new community members on the benefits of crypto index products and supporting Index Coop’s recruitment efforts for key roles.</p>

<strong>Talent Scout V2 (role gap/expertise opportunity focus)</strong> <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/bradwmorris"">@bradwmorris</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Talent scouts are high context contributors with a deep understanding of projects, goals and objectives undertaken in different nests. The Talent Scouts have played a crucial role in helping us maintain a solid cross-nest relationship and are responsible for continually identifying potential role/bounty gaps, monitoring new applications and facilitating recruitment and onboarding for their Nest.</p>

<p>Reorganising google drive into a nested model to be consistent with our nest structure and configuring permissions to folders appropriately. This will allow for better document management and security. Audit all current public-facing calendars that currently reside in multiple places (google, notion, discord, etc) and address overlapping information, and unclear ownership. Set up separate dedicated contributors calendars for C.Nest, G.Nest and P.Nest. Restrict access to these calendars to only active contributors at Index Coop.</p>

<h2>
<a name=""community-pod-24"" class=""anchor"" href=""#community-pod-24""></a>Community Pod</h2>
<p>The focus of the Community Pod is to create and grow an engaged and passionate community around Index Coop and our product. Unlike Talent, Ops and HC&amp;C, Community Pod’s focus is on non-contributors.</p>
<p>The Community Pod will continue to support Product Launches (the GMI launch is a great example of this), provide technical support, answer general queries and make our Discord a safe and welcoming environment. It is worth highlighting that a significant allocation of time and effort in Community Pod currently goes into ongoing product support.</p>
<p>As the Community Nest evolves in Season 1, we will be experimenting with a number of initiatives to understand, measure, engage and grow our community in a way that demonstrates greater product adoption. This engagement activity will largely take the form of Live Events, Written Content and Education engagement activity, focused on the growing communities within the supporters of our products.</p>
<p>The Community Pod will be experimenting with the creation of a subcommunity model, creating a repeatable template allowing us to initiate and grow healthy subcommunities for each of our products. This will drastically reduce time and financial resources required for active community management as we incentivise subcommunities themselves to market our products and field technical requests.</p>
<p>In Season 1, several existing initiatives are merging with Community Pod and becoming sub pods to align their effort with our overarching community objectives. The benefit of this sub-pod model is it allows us to leverage our diverse customer base and interact and engage this community with content that most resonates with them. These sub-pods could almost be seen as “Community brands” which enable product adoption across a variety of interests and groups.</p>
<p>We recognize that historically demonstrating the impact of community growth on product adoption has been difficult. As such, in Season 1 we will be laser focused on demonstrating the impact of these efforts through a data-led approach we call “Community Growth Attribution”. This attribution strategy will look to answer the question “what specific community engagement activity leads to greater product adoption”.</p>
<p>Ultimately we hope Season 1 will demonstrate that community growth matters and can become a powerful part of Index Coop’s value proposition in future.</p>

<p>To validate the impact of Community Growth initiatives, we need to be able to attribute this activity back to product adoption.

<p>There is an ongoing need for Community Pod to provide support for product launches (everything from events and giveaways to fielding technical, purchase, staking questions from new and potential product owners).

</ul>
<p>As we tackle more aggressive launch targets and grow our active products, we are going to need to think more strategically about how we provide a world class product support experience for potential, new and existing holders.</p>
<p>In addition to maintaining our current 24-7 product support, we will be exploring options with our methodologists and branding partners to grow and empower sub-communities that help us provide exceptional product/technical support . In an effort to scale these support services, Community pod will create and maintain a product FAQ sheet that we can refer community managers and customers to. This is also an additional asset for product launch templates.</p>

<a name=""community-brands-29"" class=""anchor"" href=""#community-brands-29""></a>“Community Brands”</h2>
<p>The Community Brands is a new initiative which enables the formation of autonomous groups who engage and build awareness with specific aspects of the Index Coop community.</p>
<p>We also recognise we have a diverse community and so some specific engagement activity is best driven through small targeted engagement groups - which we call “Community Brands”.</p>
<p>In Season 1, the these “Community Brands” include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Women &amp; Non-Binary in Index</li>
<li>sCoop (newsletter strategy)</li>
<li>Owlchemy AMA</li>
<li>DeFridays (Growth Led)</li>
<li>Conversations with the Coop (Growth Led)</li>
</ul>
<p>This enables different community-focused groups to have the autonomy to focus on direct engagement with our diverse and varied community - with these initiatives being supported by the Community Pod and having their impact demonstrated through the Community Pods attribution strategy.</p>
<p>Working in collaboration, Growth and Community Nest are proposing the revised “Engagement Mining” rewards menu for community focused activity across both C.Nest and G.Nest. These rewards may change over time.</p>

<a name=""introduction-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#introduction-1""></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>Index Coop DAO season 1 kicked off in February 2022, and we are now approaching the end of the season. We plan to use this post to take a look at how we’ve done so far against our <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/governance-nest-proposal-season-1-2022/3873"">season 1 proposal <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""3 clicks"">3</span></a>. We invite all other nests to do the same ahead of season 2 to allow for reflection, and make the transition to season 2 as frictionless and informed as possible.</p>
<h1>
<a name=""structure-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#structure-2""></a>Structure</h1>
<p>The Governance Nest season 1 proposal only had provisions for two functional areas (Pods) namely Operational Governance and MetaGovernance. And while these two Pods have been successful in their operations, we have since added an extra functional area, Governance Communications. Governance communications have done an excellent job so far supporting the two original Pods through increasing communications and awareness of Governance Nest operations. Some of the successes of the Governance Communications Pod so far have been to improve visibility on internal Governance operations, socialize how to use our Governance process, and externally communicate how Index Coop manages the governance process. Therefore, moving forward the GovComs Pod is likely to be included in the Season 2 proposal.</p>
<h1>
<a name=""primary-objectives-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#primary-objectives-3""></a>Primary Objectives</h1>
<p>During Season 1 Governance Nest had the primary objective of ‘<strong>creating and maintaining several transparent and trusted governance processes in conjunction with providing content highlighting the value of MetaGovernance and how it pertains to the INDEX token</strong>.’</p>
<p>We had started with the mantra, “Simplify Governance” and moved to more detailed objectives in concert with the Index Council v1, as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide and manage a streamlined, transparent and open governance process</li>
<li>Ensure INDEX metagovernance voting rights are utilized</li>
<li>Grow awareness and opportunities to utilize Index Coop’s metagovernance influence</li>
<li>Improve the UX and participation of INDEX voters</li>
</ol>

<a name=""pods-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#pods-4""></a>Pods</h1>
<h2>
<a name=""operational-governance-pod-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#operational-governance-pod-5""></a>Operational Governance Pod</h2>
<p>The Operational Governance pod is responsible for maintaining the Index Coop’s governance process and providing support to community members interacting with the process. This Pod will endeavour to boost participation, improve the existing process, and will work with token holders to promote awareness of the INDEX token’s governance influence. This pod will be the owner of all internal Index Coop elections for groups like the Index Council.<br>
The GovOps Pod had the Primary Objectives to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide and manage a streamlined, transparent, and open governance process</li>
<li>Improve the UX and participation of INDEX voters</li>
</ul>
<p>This was broken down into the following deliverables and responsibilities:</p>

<p>The Meta-Governance Pod is to support all metagovernance activities across the Coop and with future partners using Index Coop’s influence to implement improvement proposals on other protocols. The core of this pod is to maintain a transparent and trusted meta-goverance process which includes the MGC that votes when INDEX holders fail to quorum. This pod will work closely with other areas of the Coop to support product sales and integrations with other communities.</p>
<p>The MetaGov Pod had the Primary Objectives to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure INDEX metagovernance voting rights are utilized</li>
<li>Grow awareness and opportunities to utilize Index Coop’s metagovernance influence</li>
</ul>
<p>This was broken down into the following deliverables and responsibilities:</p>

<p>The Index Coop is a product-driven organization that is supported by the Product Nest. The ultimate goal of Product is to design, build, launch, and maintain highly-profitable on-chain products for the Index Coop. Developing successful products requires deep expertise in several key areas including assessing market demand, determining product design/composition, building product functionality, providing seed and ongoing liquidity, and analyzing product performance.</p>
<p>Product Nest offers the Index Coop community a qualified and experienced team with a proven track record within Index Coop. A number of Product nest members have been hired through the <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-128-priority-hiring-round-1/3707"">Core Team <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a> hiring process.This nest proposal intends to summarize additional budget asks excluding costs incurred through the core hiring process and will be the reference point for what this Nest delivers, responsibilities, and how performance and success are measured.</p>

<p>Index Coop’s mission is to make crypto investing simple, safe, and accessible for everyone. Product growth is a core pillar to achieving that mission. Without sufficient liquidity, our index products are less compelling to customers and product access and therefore adoption is potentially hindered. This slows our growth as a business and the negative effects only compound over time. The Liquidity Pod will work to ensure that all products have sufficient liquidity as outlined in <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/proposed-iip-110-forming-a-liquidity-pod/3241/12"">IIP-110</a> within the funding constraints of <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-125-liquidity-pod-funding-request-h1-2022/3681"">IIP-125 <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a> and done in accordance with the <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/liquidity-pod-our-product-liquidity-vision-harmonic-liquidity/3734/1"">Harmonic Liquidity Vision</a>.</p>

<a name=""summary-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#summary-2""></a>Summary</h2>
<p>As part of Index 2.0, a series of workshops were conducted to generate feedback and recommendations to inform a new “Future of Finance” for Index Cooperative.</p>
<p>A team of Domain Experts from across Treasury WG, the Funding Council and POC have consolidated these outputs into this comprehensive proposal to reimagine Index Coop’s financial and administrative capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Key changes include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dissolving of the Funding Council as a body which determines and funds ad-hoc rewards and WG proposals.</li>
<li>The consolidation of all of Index Coops financial capabilities, including payroll, into a new “Finance Nest”</li>
<li>The transition of operational funding from the Funding Council multi-wallet (primarily Set signers) into the Operations Account (all Index Coop signers)</li>
<li>The creation of a new “Innovation Hub” design to support the launch of new initiatives/Working Groups. This group will also seek external grant funding through bodies such as Gitcoin and Uniswap grants</li>
</ul>
<p>As Domain Experts, we feel the recommendations offered here will enable Index Coop to level up and will support Index Coops long term financial sustainability and growth.</p>

<a name=""h-1-background-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#h-1-background-3""></a>1. Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>Index 2.0 - On August 25, 2021, the forum post <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-2-0-autonomy-next-steps/2475"">Index 2.0: Autonomy Next Steps  <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""5 clicks"">5</span></a>kicked off the ongoing workshop process. “Future of Finance” has been one of the workshop themes. It has covered “Financial and Administrative capabilities” in the Coop.</li>
<li>Future of Finance Workshops - Two workshops have been run
<ul>
<li>Workshop <span class=""hashtag"">#1</span> set the stage for the community to come together and brainstorm on an overhauled structure (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC71LkU4UJU"">Session Recording</a>, <a href=""https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t-T7DwP46xmljDLU32q6OegGjSA0l6vi0EsZaCo81D0/edit#slide=id.ge8b3b2d984_0_333"">Deck <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a>, <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/finance-of-the-future-1-workshop-outputs-next-steps/2581"">Forum Post 1</a>)</li>
<li>Workshop <span class=""hashtag"">#2</span> was a forum for participants to dive deeper into some of the outputs of the first workshop and begin thinking about the big picture, values/principles, and what an ideal structure might look like (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WBR8Ay-_Qo"">Session Recording <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a>, <a href=""https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N6-pYv59YjCrcqgfdhwVVoaGynCn7fqrWrOq1Tz6ibM/edit#slide=id.gef91041311_0_0"">Deck 1 <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a>). Workshop <span class=""hashtag"">#2</span> provided clarity on a number of topics like key financial goals for Index coop, exploring the remit of the Funding Council, the structural overhaul of the finance organization, and decision making. This resulted in the above authors gaining a sense of alignment within the community.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Next Steps

<h2>
<a name=""h-2-our-vision-principles-and-impact-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#h-2-our-vision-principles-and-impact-4""></a>2. Our Vision, Principles and Impact</h2>
<p>The purpose of this section is to, as best as possible, articulate the vision we are pursuing.</p>
<p>We believe it is important to try to make this clear as, while this forum posts puts forward some immediate proposed changes, we also believe that there is more work to be done.</p>
<p>We hope the vision and principles displayed below provide guidance as the Coop continues to evolve its financial abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Our vision…</strong></p>
<p>We have a vision of the financial arm of the Index Coop as a unified collection of teams that continues to be the go-to resource for innovative, efficient, and trusted financial operations in crypto.</p>
<p><strong>Our principles…</strong></p>
<p>To pursue our vision we believe our approach should be guided by the following principles.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Financial</strong> (<a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/twg-treasury-diversification-proposal/1157"">Sustain, Preserve, Grow <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a>)
<ul>
<li>Grow: We should make decisions with a long-term view. We seek to act within a predetermined framework and make strategic decisions that accelerate growth and build the Index Coop moat. We are laying the foundation for becoming the Blackrock of crypto.</li>
<li>Sustain: In time, we will need to fund our expenses from revenue. We will need to fund recurring expenses like full time salaries, community rewards, various incentive schemes in effort to attain our <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/reaffirming-our-focus-north-star-core-kpis/912"">North Star <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a> objectives from the revenue we generate. We need to consider the long term viability of our operating model and ensure that future generations of owls can flourish. We are building a community that will be funded in perpetuity from internal token flow.</li>
<li>Preserve: We should seek to build a strong treasury which can withstand any future “crypto winter”. Investment yields and product revenue should fund a proportion of our spend.</li>
<li>We want to be conscientious ecosystem participants and avoid investing in products or areas which harm the ecosystem or have negative connotations. To stand up for this will require courage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Transparency &amp; Accountability</strong>
<ul>
<li>Transparency: By operating on ethereum, everything we do is visible to everyone. As stewards of the community’s financial assets, we are obligated to be the best stewards we can be. Providing visibility and context is key to building community trust and confidence - not just within the community at large, but also with current and prospective investors. Credibility and trust are built through transparency.</li>
<li>Transparency: Processes should be shared and discussed in an open and transparent manner. An example: The recurring distribution of funds like contributor rewards shall have clear guide rails, transparent process and an open feedback mechanism in place. Index Coop shall provide open transparent processes, with a data-led feedback mechanism that is always meritocratic.</li>
<li>Accountability: Everyone at Index Coop needs to be accountable to the community, the Finance Nest provides the data, insight and context by which community members can make an informed decision regarding funding and requests going forward. Great ideas will rise above and good ideas may fade.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Solid Foundation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Stable building blocks for a successful future of the DAO we will look to build with a Community driven approach. Ensuring that the correct financial foundations are laid early in the DAO’s lifecycle to enable a platform for future financial stability and success.</li>
<li>Prudent risk management: Through conservative and well thought out iterative steps that reflect our culture of continuous improvement and preserving the community’s assets, the Finance Nest will deliver prudent risk management. From here, we increase our upside potential through adopting a more managed approach to risk, knowing that safety/security are paramount, “Security is an important unforkable source of competitive advantage that attracts capital to a protocol” (<a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/notes-defi-citadels-by-ryan-watkins/1009"">DeFi Citadels</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Continues Improvement</strong>
<ul>
<li>Iterations: In balance with being “safety first,” we will not make decisions out of fear and are willing to test out new hypotheses and look to get better every day.</li>
<li>Evolution: by balancing opportunity with a safety first mentality, we expect our financial institutions to evolve over time through innovation</li>
<li>Unified Finance: We need to be proactive in ensuring our financial activities work in unison and to serve the Coop as a whole.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our impact…</strong></p>
<p>Ultimately, through pursuing this vision, guided by our core principles we hope to make the following impact</p>
<ol>
<li>Thriving Community - Individual Coop contributors feel enabled and supported to deliver impact through a well-functioning financial arm of the Coop.</li>
<li>Wealth Creation - The Coop as an organization is set up financially to support <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/treasury-management-goals/989"">growth, sustainability, and preservation <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a> of our assets.</li>
<li>Owlphaneers - We continue to be seen as pioneers, pushing the boundaries of DAO finance.</li>
</ol>

<p>Our existing Financial processes are somewhat muddled, with activity and responsibility sitting across a number of entities, including Funding Council, Treasury WG and People, Organization and Community.</p>

<h2>
<a name=""h-4-challenges-and-issues-6"" class=""anchor"" href=""#h-4-challenges-and-issues-6""></a>4. Challenges and Issues</h2>
<p><strong>Autonomy &amp; Legitimacy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Funding Council Composition - <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/the-funding-council-is-adding-1-new-member/2284"">Funding Council signers</a> are currently Dylan, Puniavision, Gregdocter and DarkForestCapital (3/4 Set Community Managers). The composition of the signers understates the communities representation within the protocol (copy/pasted from <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z6XzKX_ef4Smc_YVkVxK_cnFUSlKXXK6bEFiMKwiIaY/edit#gid=0"">major issues and potential solutions</a>). Furthermore, some Set Community Managers are stepping away from Index Coop for more Set Labs orientated roles.</li>
<li>Funding Council Accountability - With respect to WG proposals, the Funding Council feels it lacks legitimacy to continuously challenge WGs and/or decline funding requests (seen as “picking on” WGs). Thus, the Funding Council has provided one batch of feedback to WGs. In this quarter this feedback led to no meaningful change for ANY Working Group proposals.</li>
<li>Reward outcomes - In some instances, reward outcomes are determined by members of Set (who are on the Funding Council). This was flagged as a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z6XzKX_ef4Smc_YVkVxK_cnFUSlKXXK6bEFiMKwiIaY/edit#gid=0"">major issue in need of a potential solution</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transparency &amp; Fairness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rewards and Contribution - Contributors do not feel they clearly understand what the reward process is - and feel that the reward outcomes are often unfair. Greater transparency is needed from a contributor perspective and from a WGL perspective.</li>
<li>Rewards Equality - Feeling that the reward outcomes are not equitable between themselves and other contributors. There has also been a lack of standardisation in the rewards approach between WGs.</li>
<li>No framework for funding initiatives outside of WGs - The Funding Council has lacked the remit or muscle to appropriately support and fund new initiatives and WGs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clear Roles and Responsibilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Overlapping Financial Responsibilities - People Organization and Community, Funding Council and Treasury WG significantly overlap in regards to managing, funding and reporting on contributor rewards. The various process handovers create inefficiencies and a bad experience for contributors within the rewards process.</li>
<li>Wallet Structure - Presently there are two multi-sigs coordinating operational expenditure, the Funding Council wallet and the Operations Account. This represents duplication and inefficiencies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Financial Sustainability</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Budget - To date the Coop has no robust mechanism for budgeting or other financial restraint. We indeed want healthy spending to drive aggressive growth but this needs to be moderated by overarching strategic objectives.</li>
<li>Equity v Expenses - Misalignment of equity and expenses. It makes sense for Index Coop to revisit the Equity for rebalancing product cost arrangement with Set Labs. Similar can be said when framing Index Coop as a start up and the founding party normally reduces equity into growth. Currently, equity is linked to a known fully diluted supply figure that would otherwise not exist in a traditional start up model. As Index Coop expands - community ownership v major founding party relative ownership per contribution diverge. Creating a more autonomous Index Coop accelerates the cost transfer from Set to Index Coop but not the equity, unless action is taken within INDEX 2.0. Whilst not directly addressed here, this will be explored through the Compensation and Community Ownership theme.</li>
<li>Gas Costs - All Index Coop wallets spanning WG level to Treasury are not fund funded with ETH to support transaction costs. This leads to market selling INDEX for ETH and can be managed in a more holistic manner streamlining how transactions are funded.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Community Funds</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Control: Currently, the Treasury wallet has zero native Index Coop signers. As a result processing transactions is limited to a select few and at times a single transfer can take weeks. Index Coop lags behind the majority of DeFi Protocols in this area. The reliance on employees from a founding party is a security risk, a governance attack vector risk and a source of general frustration within the community at large.</li>
<li>Autonomous: Lack of control of the communities main wallet, impact autonomy there is little autonomy. Every large expense is vetted by Set Labs employees and soft control is understated. Further to this, a lot of smart contract permissions are now linked to the communities treasuries. It is not best practice to have permissioned wallet addresses within product infrastructure models containing the community life savings.</li>
<li>Contributors: All of the communities INDEX is consolidated into a single wallet and it is not clear what the intended purpose of these INDEX tokens are. An ongoing issue is that there is no clear allocation to contributors within the token distribution. Other DAO have community allocations that are known and put aside for future community members. Creating a wallet to hold, or at least a known allocation of INDEX that is put aside for contributors will go a long way to providing future security for contributors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Many of these challenges have been demonstrated during the Q4 Budget process</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Funding Council as an institution unsuitable to support the volume of applications and provide enough support, review and rigour to WG proposals.</li>
<li>The Funding Council does not have the legitimacy to push back on excessive spend. No amendments to any proposals budgets were made in Q4. The most simplest alignment for WG uses the same USD INDEX price when determining stipends did not happen in Q4.</li>
<li>Anonymous “final poll” also failed. Ostensibly, the Coop should not fund every proposal. Yet, every proposal received nearly 100% support. We have created a culture where we each vote each other’s proposal forward and expect the same in return. Thus bypassing constructive criticism or prudent financial spending. Many proposals are not linked to the North Stars.</li>
<li>Currently the process actively discourages challenges as there is an expectation of WGLs providing challenge on proposal - but they are directly incentivised not to do this through the current framework (which would increase the risk of their own proposal being pushed back on). More than that, to expand our most high level individuals to review ALL WG proposals and provide feedback is simply unsustainable.</li>
<li>Lack of clarity on who could decide proposed funding structure (i.e. TWG proposing payment alteration etc) ambiguity around certain funding criteria (INDEX used, timeline etc) led to confusion on what was “fair” pay.</li>
<li>New initiatives such as the sCoop not clearly falling into any existing framework or funding structure - resulting in disputes.</li>
</ul>

<a name=""h-6-introducing-concept-of-nest-9"" class=""anchor"" href=""#h-6-introducing-concept-of-nest-9""></a>6. Introducing concept of “Nest”</h2>
<p>Before we dig into the structural changes proposed as part of Finance of the Future, we felt it important to introduce a new organizational design concept: the “Nests”.</p>
<p>A major part of Future of Finance has been focused on transitioning core financial activity into one functional group. We call this our “Finance Nest”.</p>
<p>The logic behind this is that the “Finance Nest” can represent all core “Finance” capability within Index Coop. There are many synergies and benefits to this. This “Nest” consists of a series of semi-autonomous verticals, each of which is highly accountable for individual performance.</p>
<p>Through consensus, the Finance Nest selected two leads (in this case Matthew and Elliott) to coordinate cross-functionally. Funding for a Nest is provided at a high level through proposal, with the coordinators then allocating funds to support the activity happening in each different vertical.</p>
<p><strong>This addresses the following issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Coordination - instead of having multiple disconnected WGs, all financial activity is managed within a broad group, with leaders supporting the coordination of core “capabilities” (the verticals). This improves efficiency and the quality of decision making.</li>
<li>Accountability - by modulating capabilities into verticals and initiatives and assigning performance targets to each vertical, accountability can be increased and poor performance better identified and rectified. See TOC or the Finance Nest proposal for more details.</li>
<li>Working Group approach - The title “Working Group” is almost entirely meaningless, as is “WGL”. Recently, we have seen new WG forms, or split from existing ones, thus creating new WGLs. By arbitrarily grouping functions into WGs, we create a rigid, lethargic system which creates silos, reduces merotiacry and stifles innovation. Greater accountability of the verticals within a Nest allows fair more fluidity and room for experimentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are experimenting with this model as part of the Future of Finance. Success here could set the “Nest” model up to be extended across the DAO and help address a variety of our coordination and decision making challenges. There is lots much discussion ont come on this model as part of Index 2.0, but a future structure could look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Growth Nest - BD, IB, Growth, CDWG, APAC*, Language Ops</li>
<li>Community Nest - TOC, sCoop, Women in Index, Community &amp; Culture Guild</li>
<li>Technology Nest - Product, Engineering, Analytics</li>
<li>Governance - Governance Operations, MetaGov committee</li>
</ul>
<p>*<em>noting that APAC is currently operating in a matrix model, with multiple capabilities coordinating via a regional focused block</em></p>
<p>If brought functional areas were grouped into Nests, outside of the benefits shared about for the Finance Nest, we would see:</p>
<ul>
<li>An evolution of the WG model to help address the challenges created by multiple WGs (both old and new) having to request funding each quarter. Potentially instead, each Nest requests/is allocated funding for all activity falling into their area, and then internally works to determine how to best allocate funds to the different semi-autonomous verticals.</li>
<li>Encourages a culture of experimentation, as different Nest can experiment with different structural or leadership and organization</li>
<li>Each nest could conduct their own elections for a “coordinator team” to steward the group internally, and coordinate cross functionally with different Nests. The Nest members themselves would be encouraged to experiment and propose their own models for selected individuals to represent them in this “coordinator” role.</li>
<li>Encourage better cross pollination of ideas and coordination between different groups at Index Coop. Encourages greater integration and collaboration between WGs that fall under the same Nest.</li>
<li>Nest proposals could be staggered every 3 months (i.e. Community Nest in Q1, Growth Nest in Q2) with proposals that then run for 6 months. Nest would work together to prepare a robust proposal, enabling geater iterations and improvement.</li>
<li>The emphasis on semi autonomous verticals within each Nest is staying true to our decentralised / autonomous core principles</li>
</ul>
<p>Given this is a Future of Finance post, a more expansive exploration on Nests is outside the scope of this post. However, for illustrative purposes broader adoption of the Nest model could leave Index Coop coordinating in the following way.</p>

<p>With the changes proposed by the Future of Finance, the Funding Council will be dissolved and merged into the Treasury WG - with this new function becoming the Finance Nest.</p>
<p>Reflecting this expanded role, the Treasury Working (TWG) structure was changed to reflect the emergence of clear domain specialists within the Finance Nest. Thus, going forward activities will be split into three distinct verticals which will operate semi-autonomously and be accountable to deliver against their respective objectives and initiatives.</p>
<ul>
<li>Accountability
<ul>
<li>Responsible for the overall review of the DAO’s finances through providing meaningful data lead analysis on WG proposals, financial sustainability and forward forecasting initiatives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Operational Funding &amp; Payroll (Operations account multi-sig)
<ul>
<li>Responsible for the overall transactional processing of DAO expenses and providing oversight of the contributor rewards process, ensuring maximum efficiency and timely execution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Treasury
<ul>
<li>Investment Account - Responsible for the direction and sustainability of the DAO’s finances through diversification of assets and strategic investments with DeFi partners.</li>
<li>INDEX Account - This wallet holds INDEX to be managed separate from the Operations and Investments Accounts. Day to day execution will be implemented by the “Index Stewards” with Finance Nest support as required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A detailed proposal articulating the structure, objectives, key results and initiatives for the Finance Nest can be found [<a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/proposal-finance-nest-f-nest-q4-2021/2968"">here</a>]. Long term given the logical and structural distinction between these verticals, they can be split up into separate WGs / Funded bodies.</p>

<ul>
<li>Builders &gt; Bureaucrats</li>
<li>We need strong, product focused, humble, tenacious leaders who are AMBITIOUS and will drive us to create / grow / maintain products.</li>
<li>They need to be the highest/executive level thinkers and people of a character that embody the values IC wants to be known for.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let this be the primary filter when vetting candidates.</p>
<p><strong>To begin</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been thinking through our <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/nominations-active-index-council-v2-nomination-thread-and-process/4040/13"">nomination</a> conversation, and our seeming eagerness to nominate a bunch of folks we think would just do a good job.</p>
<p>But I want to start by reiterating Set’s position, in order for Index Coop to have longevity and go from good to great, Index Coop’s <strong>immediate, and primary focus</strong> should be on activities that <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/set-s-intentions-and-next-steps/3994"">create, grow, and maintain</a> successful investor products. I have a concern around how much time and energy here is spent on these forums, talking/debating about the best way to do things. We often swirl rather than having a Tech Startup/Experimental mentality.</p>
<p>Having said that, on the topic of leadership, we need to start recognizing our leaders will need success not only in this area, but they’ll need to <strong>embody</strong> characteristics that make them leaders worth following.</p>
<p>So I have a few thoughts on leadership before we all make some lasting decisions here. This conversation wasn’t had the <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-2-0-leadership-governance-and-decision-making-pods-nest-and-wise-owls/3214"">first time around</a>, (instead we were <strong>hyper-focused</strong> on responsibilities and decision making authority, and troubleshooting, and engineering org structures). But if we have the will to think about it now, it will change not only the Coop, but the DeFi space as a whole, even the Cryptoverse, and the world (not to mention our personal experiences). I’m convinced these frameworks will help us think about true leadership outside of just ‘gettin it done’. This is important because <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/What-Got-Here-Wont-There-ebook/dp/B000Q9J128"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">‘What got us here, won’t get us there’ <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a></p>
<p>“We’re going to see a 21st century shift, from a society of <strong>organizations well managed</strong> - to the world being organized into a society of <strong>networks well led</strong>. You don’t manage a network. If this is right, we’re going to need great leadership distributed throughout all sectors.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim Collins [cir. 2015]</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t already know, Jim Collins is a genius. And much of his team’s research in <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Some-Companies-Others-ebook/dp/B0058DRUV6/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1688RJE5WT45R&amp;keywords=good+to+great&amp;qid=1647957026&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=good+to+great%2Cdigital-text%2C91&amp;sr=1-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Good to Great</a> DIRECTLY applies to the tough problems we’re trying to solve together at Index Coop. Go read it.</p>
<p>After teaching leaders at Westpoint, he gave a talk at the 2015 Global Leadership Summit that is pertinent here. I’ve distilled some of his thinking below.</p>
<p>But first, I believe <strong>we rise and fall by our definitions</strong>, and much of our debating here arises from ‘definition deltas’. So in your mind, set the word ‘leadership’ aside for a moment (with whatever baggage that carries for you), and ask the question. <strong>What does it mean to Lead Well</strong>?</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s easier to define things by what they’re not.</p>
<p>The data show that successful Leadership is <strong>not</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personality</li>
<li>Position</li>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Rank</li>
<li>Power</li>
</ul>
<p>To quote <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_MacGregor_Burns"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">James MacGregor Burns</a>, “True leadership only exists if people follow when they would otherwise have the freedom to not. To invoke power, or rank, or position, or title as your primary means to getting things done is an <strong>abdication</strong> of leadership.”</p>
<p>I mean, how often do we get Personality confused with Leading Well, right?</p>
<p>I have some level of personal (or at least solid working) relationship with many of the v1 wise Owls <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/pepperoni_joe"">@Pepperoni_Joe</a>, <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/metfanmike"">@Metfanmike</a>, <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/lemonadealpha"">@LemonadeAlpha</a>, <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/matthew_graham"">@Matthew_Graham</a>. I respect these Kings and look up to them. They are all great people that have technical proficiency and strong ideas of what’s best for the Coop.</p>
<p>But I’m convinced the Coop (all of us), have suffered from continued <strong>operationally focused</strong> leadership to the exclusion of the biggest picture. While we need the operational layer, we’re so myopically focused on the ‘what’, that we don’t even have capacity to first think about who embodies the qualities that are representative of the <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/what-we-learned-from-the-survey/2622/12"">Coop’s Values <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a>. We’re doers by nature, and there’s plenty to do.<br>
(What do we value, by the way? This post was clearly a lot of work, and references ‘values’ dozens of times, but to my knowledge didn’t result in a widely adopted or publicized artifact of <a href=""https://www.southwestairlinesinvestorrelations.com/our-company/purpose-vision-and-the-southwest-way"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">purpose/guiding values</a>, or our <a href=""https://www.inc.com/entrepreneurs-organization/a-labor-of-love-how-to-craft-your-companys-core-values.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">“way of life”</a>. See also: <a href=""https://hbr.org/2002/07/make-your-values-mean-something?cm_sp=Article-_-Links-_-Comment"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Harvard Business Review</a> on meaningless values jargon). We’ll need this to calculate our North Star.</p>
<p>We’re so busy working <strong>in</strong> the Coop that we haven’t prioritized working <strong>on</strong> the Coop - the very thing that will tee us up to hit our <strong>TVL</strong> goals.</p>

<p>*Definition - <a href=""https://iveybusinessjournal.com/publication/leaders-of-good-character/"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Leaders of Character</a> here are not defined by the specific skill sets they bring to the table, or their Personality, Position, Title, Rank, Power. We already have many technically competent people in critical positions and many with significant political power. Leaders of Character in this context are defined by the highest level 10,000 ft view thinking and their embodiment of the values the Coop stands for.</p>
<p><strong>On the Art of leading well</strong></p>
<p>“Leadership is the art of getting people <em>to want</em> to do what must be done”<br>
<strong>-Gen. Eisenhower</strong></p>
<p>Observations on this quote:</p>
<ol>
<li>Part of the responsibility of being a leader is to figure out, on the big things, what must be done, and much more often than not, to be right.</li>
<li>It’s not about getting people to do what must be done, it’s about getting them to want to do what must be done</li>
<li>It’s not a science, it’s an art</li>
</ol>
<p>“A Level 4 leader is good at inspiring people to follow <strong>them</strong>. A <a href=""https://rickkettner.com/level-5-leadership/"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">level 5 leader <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a> is good at inspiring people to follow the <strong>cause.</strong>”</p>
<p><strong>On Decision Making:</strong></p>
<p>The most empowering thing I can do as a leader is look at the leaders around me and say “You decide”</p>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes a leader can make is making all the decisions. When you do that, you undermine the development of the leaders around you. Make as few decisions as possible - pushing the decision down as far as possible.</p>
<p>For our context, I believe the Council should be pushing decisions down to relevant  leaders and when necessary, pushing them to assembled <a href=""http://www.lifesmostpowerfulquestion.com/about-win"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">WIN teams <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""2 clicks"">2</span></a> for urgent focus on specific critical issues, with the aim to make strategic recommendations on the tactics needed to move the biggest obstacles blocking us from our <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/discussion-on-councils-vision-from-leadership-forum/3653"">Vision</a>.</p>
<p>Which candidates do we believe embody this idea, maintaining the <strong>10,000 foot, executive</strong> view and not ‘getting in the weeds’? Who is willing to push decisions down when possible for the good of the Coop? Who isn’t a candidate yet, who embodies these leader qualities?</p>
<p><strong>On Bad decisions/mistakes:</strong></p>
<p>We never gain more respect for leaders who are not willing to own their mistakes. People will forgive leaders for making bad decisions, in fact you can actually gain moral authority and credibility by owning your bad decision, but you lose both when you cover up.</p>
<p>Tell the truth</p>
<p>Tell it fast</p>
<p>Tell it yourself</p>
<p><strong>On Leader Development:</strong></p>
<p>We should give people opportunities they’re not quite ready for, and then refuse to make decisions for them.</p>
<p>Strong, product focused, newer leaders that while humble, are AMBITIOUS and drive us to create / grow / maintain products both early and late adopters will love, should be given opportunities for decision making. This is the only way to ensure our Leadership Pipeline is producing the leaders the Coop needs (we need WAY more than just the Council), and that DeFi is desperate for.</p>
<p><strong>5 Characteristics of a Leader worth following:</strong></p>
<p>I believe there are 5 characteristics that make a leader worth following. You don’t have to have these 5 things to be a leader, but I’m convinced you do have to have these 5 things to be a leader worth following. I’m still exploring, and I have lots of questions around each of these that I’d love input on.</p>
<p>The idea is to <strong>become</strong> a leader worth following, and to <strong>embody</strong> these five things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Clarity</strong>
<ul>
<li>As leaders <strong>we can be uncertain</strong> but we <strong>cannot be unclear</strong>
</li>
<li>Clarity in leaders trumps everything - people follow clarity, they don’t follow integrity (look at all of politics throughout all of history)
<ul>
<li>Why? Clarity creates certainty which is really what people want - the wallets holding our products, our external partners, and our investors</li>
<li>Which <strong>candidates</strong> have we consistently seen the most clarity from in their understanding and Vision for the Big Picture?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Courage</strong>
<ul>
<li>Are we willing to leverage more than our ability to be clear, so that at the end of the day there is a legacy - something to look back on?</li>
<li>What does courage look like in the context of leadership?</li>
<li>Which of our leaders are brave enough to say <strong>“No”</strong> even if it jeopardizes their ‘political’ standing in the Coop bureaucracy?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Competence</strong>
<ul>
<li>Technical proficiency and holistic context to understand the biggest picture issues</li>
<li>How do we measure something like this? What are big picture KPI’s, $INDEX price? Budget cutting?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Coachability</strong>
<ul>
<li>“I assume I’m not the smartest person in the room, I’m just the leader”</li>
<li>Are our leaders comfortable with saying “I don’t know” when needed? This should be a celebrated posture for leaders. Who currently embodies this level of humility? Who is actively practicing this?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Character</strong>
<ul>
<li>The will to do what’s right, even when it costs you something</li>
<li>What does this look like in our context for Nest leads or the Council or Pod leads?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One more <strong>TLDR;</strong> We’ve been focusing on only a part of the picture, and therefore starting from inaccurate assumptions and unhelpful lenses. Let’s fix this for today, and <strong>future</strong> conversations around <strong>leading well</strong> in the Coop.</p>
<p>I’d be honored to hear your feelings and thoughts on this as we consider our options and take steps forward.</p>",Index,nic,

<h2>
<a name=""objective-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#objective-2""></a>Objective</h2>
<p>Proposing a simplified owl level framework with more objective thresholds for progression and regression. Owl levels will be automatically updated on a rolling monthly basis relative to a retroactive assessment of contributor reward allocation.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""summary-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#summary-3""></a>Summary</h2>
<p>Owl levels have been an ongoing challenge/distraction over the past six months. In an effort to streamline the owl level process, contributor voting and ensure we’re<a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-coop-open-letter/4147""> incentivising high impact work, top talent <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""3 clicks"">3</span></a> and operational efficiency, we’re suggesting a simplified owl level framework for Season 2, with Owl Levels being used exclusively to determine weight for contributor voting.</p>
<p>We are proposing three owl levels:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Gold Owls (4 x vote weighting). Core contributors. Individuals who are on fixed salary (have been taken through the core team hiring process).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Silver Owls (2 x vote weighting). Consistent flexible contributors. Individuals compensated from the flexible budget who have earned at least $6,000 over the past three months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bronze Owls (1 x vote weighting). Newer or less consistent contributors. Individuals compensated from the flexible budget who have earned between $1500 and $5999 over the last three months.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>*<strong>Thresholds are pending final review from finance <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/hammad1412"">@Hammad1412</a></strong></p>
<h2>
<a name=""progression-and-regression-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#progression-and-regression-4""></a>Progression and regression</h2>
<p>Owl levels will be automatically updated each month. With Owl Levels displayed on a tab within the monthly rewards sheet.</p>
<p>Any Silver or Bronze Owls who exceed or fall short of the compensation thresholds mentioned above will have their owl levels automatically updated.</p>
<p>Gold Owl (full time hires) will need to be confirmed by the Nest Lead and Index Council to ensure the hires are aligned with both contributor roadmap and seasonal budget, and required to participate in ongoing impact alignment/performance review (more to come in Season 2).</p>
<h2>
<a name=""weighted-contributor-voting-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#weighted-contributor-voting-5""></a>Weighted contributor voting</h2>
<p>The primary function of Owl Levels is weighted contributor voting.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year we established a contributor voting system through Snapshot + Unlock Protocol - NFTs have been distributed to contributors on Polygon. We will continue to use the vote weighting #’s below for both Snapshot and Choicevote.</p>
<p><img src=""https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/theindexdao/original/2X/4/48a3f358fe8df1800472e92608c560557e83844b.png"" alt=""Simplified Owl Level framework and Vote Weighting - Google Docs 2022-06-18 at 7.11.12 am"" data-base62-sha1=""amBDHyplal25CpNRqUlCszh3lqj"" width=""573"" height=""133"" loading=""lazy"" style=""aspect-ratio: 573 / 133;""></p>
<p>Contributors Owl level will be associated with the following vote weight multipliers</p>
<ul>
<li>Gold Owls: 4x</li>
<li>Silver Owls: 2x</li>
<li>Bronze Owls: 1x</li>
</ul>
<p>Decisions relating directly to internal contributor operations can be proposed for contributor vote by any existing contributor (Bronze, Silver, Gold). They can recommend the preferred tools of Choicevote or Snapshot.</p>
<p>If there is contention surrounding whether or not a vote should be contributor or IIP, we will default to IIP.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""non-active-contributor-vote-participation-6"" class=""anchor"" href=""#non-active-contributor-vote-participation-6""></a>Non active contributor vote participation</h3>
<p>We recognize that in some circumstances individuals may be well positioned to participate in contributor voting but not qualify with the required compensation to meet owl level thresholds.</p>
<p>To accomodate for these fringe cases, we propose that any existing Gold Owl can request that that an individual who does not meet the eligibility thresholds still be assigned an Owl Level and be able to participate in the voting.</p>
<p>These applications will be approved via a rank order contributor vote. Existing contributors are able to vote in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support Gold</li>
<li>Support Silver</li>
<li>Do not support</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name=""next-steps-7"" class=""anchor"" href=""#next-steps-7""></a>Next steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Prior to launching Season 2, we’ll adjust all owl levels based on the above framework, applying a retroactive compensation check.</li>
<li>The Owl Levels sheet will be maintained by Finance Nest and shared monthly as a tab within the contributor rewards sheet. We will update Owl Level changes and Polygon NFT’s for contributor voting on a monthly basis with contributor rewards.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please let us know if there are any questions.</p>",Index,bradwmorris,

<p>Adopt a Code of Conduct for the Index Cooperative community.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""abstract-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#abstract-2""></a>Abstract</h2>

<p>Adopt and make visible a Code of Conduct for the community to abide by. The basis for the text is taken from the widely used <a href=""https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/"">Contributor Covenant <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""4 clicks"">4</span></a>, but has sections relating to ‘enforcement’ removed, as Index Coop currently has no leadership structure and should apply the code collaboratively.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""motivation-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#motivation-3""></a>Motivation</h2>

<p>As the Index Cooperative continues to grow it is important we have defined a set of standards upheld by community members. The community is currently acting in an inclusive and respectful way, so this should just be a tick-box exercise that codifies the expectation.<br>
Similar projects have added this type of framework retroactively after struggling without an agreed standard to refer to. The motivation here is that while Index Coop currently functions fine without a CoC, we want to avoid leaving it too late and getting into a situation where it becomes necessary to adopt in hindsight.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""specification-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#specification-4""></a>Specification</h2>
<h3>

<a name=""governance-nest-after-action-report-aar-process-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#governance-nest-after-action-report-aar-process-1""></a>Governance Nest: After Action Report (AAR) Process</h1>
<p>From our guiding principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’re on an never ending journey of growth &amp; improvement: We value growing as individuals, as a cooperative, and as a broader community. We respectfully challenge each other and our assumptions, constantly searching for new areas to grow, whatever “grow” might mean. We recognize our current plan can always be improved and that the world is dynamic and constantly changing - thus we collectively need to adapt and change too.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name=""the-business-need-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#the-business-need-2""></a>The business need:</h2>
<p>As a learning organization - it’s helpful to systematically drive process improvements via thoughtful reviews of significant events across the Co-op. To do this, it’s helpful to have a framework to consistently execute reviews and capture learnings. This post proposes to reapply (loosely) the After Action Report (AAR) process and is part of the Governance Improvement Process (GIP)</p>
<h2>
<a name=""the-process-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#the-process-3""></a>The process:</h2>
<p>The objective of this process is to quickly yet systematically collect feedback after an event with the intent to improve future operations. Based on the “After Action Report” process developed by the US Military and loosely linked to the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Leaders-Guide-After-Action-Reviews-Training/dp/1463624255"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">TC 25-20 “A leader’s guide to After-Action Reviews</a>” this survey is not intended to find blame, fault, or identify scapegoats. The sole purpose of this process is to document what worked and what did not work as a way of informing future efforts and to build a culture of self reflection and continuous improvement. At Index Coop, we are on a never ending journey of self improvement, and the AAR is a tool we can use to do that.</p>
<p>After-action reviews are conducted during or immediately after each event and start with the focus of the intended objectives - what was the objective of the action. The audience should include the contributors, leaders, and ancillary stakeholders, remembering to involve as many participants in the discussion as feasible. It is helpful to use open-ended questions and if possible, link responses to documented core principles of the DAO. The output is to document the strengths and weaknesses of the execution, identify any unintended consequences (positive or negative) and to finally develop a short list of recommendations which may include process changes, objective adjustments, or additional training.</p>
<p>Getting it done in 3 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Planning phase</li>
</ol>
<p>A solid outline of the effort up front results in better results and better perception of a fair and equitable process. If you rush the planning phase you end up “learning by doing” and later interviews can be disproportionately weighted as the process is refined. You can protect against this by setting up a thoughtful interview process.</p>
<p>Specific steps in planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop the timeline &amp; outline the plan</li>
<li>Determine the list of target interviewees</li>
<li>Pilot 3 to 4 interviews to test process</li>
<li>Select and train qualified AAR contributors</li>
</ul>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>Conducting phase</li>
</ol>
<p>This is where the team goes out and solicits feedback on the event. It is important to find interviewers who can record responses impartially - they don’t have to be impartial, but they need to recognize the survey is not about them, it’s about getting accurate feedback. As conducting, seek maximum participation and maintain focus on the objectives - avoid casting blame and keep the interview focused on the scope, don’t let it turn into a general bitch fest. As you capture results, record the key themes and try to prioritize the input based on the subjects responses.</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>Wrapping up phase</li>
</ol>
<p>As surveys return, draft an impartial analysis on the data to identify the following points:</p>
<ol>
<li>General sentiment of the action (positive / negative)</li>
<li>Summary of what worked and what didn’t work</li>
<li>Identify any urgent issues that need to be resolved</li>
<li>Develop a list of recommendations for future improvements</li>
</ol>
<p>For clarity, the final report must contain the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Summary of sentiment: showing the depth and range of opinions<br>
** Outline of work worked based on feedback<br>
** Outline what did not work and needs to be improved</li>
<li>Collection of improvement ideas<br>
** As best possible - summarize &amp; quantify recommendations</li>
<li>AAR Process suggestions<br>
** What about this process worked and what did not work<br>
** How to adjust the format for future investigations</li>
</ul>

<p>To note: this After Action Review will use the March 08 Retro meeting with Chase Chapman as a starting point - that effort will go deep on collecting and quantifying community sentiment. This second step will go deep on collecting recommended actions and improvements while making sure we have captured as much feedback as possible. Once both efforts are completed, it is our intention to build a retro / AAR process that anyone can use in the future to collect community feedback and to articulate future improvement ideas.</p>

<h3>
<a name=""part-2-what-worked-well-9"" class=""anchor"" href=""#part-2-what-worked-well-9""></a>Part 2: What worked well?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hint 1 look for specific examples to get the person thinking about the question. If you hear “we all got along” - dive into that with “can you think of a specific example of a time when “you got along” - tell me about that? Specific examples will led to a richer conversation than empty phrases which don’t add depth to the analysis</li>
<li>Hint 2: The answer will turn into a rambling list - capture each response to “what worked” and dig into each question below for each “what worked”
<ul>
<li>Example: “we got along famously and the process was clear, we moved way faster then we ever could have, and those who disagree are just a bunch of ninnies” becomes:
<ul>
<li>A1: we got along Ask Q2, Q3,</li>
<li>A2: Process was clear Ask Q2, Q3,</li>
<li>A3: we moved fast Ask Q2, Q3,</li>
<li>A4 (to what didn’t work) Not everyone agreed (were ninnies)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hint 3: people always want to jump to “what didn’t work” - don’t let them do this. Focus on what worked and get them to indicate a few things that they perceive went well. This sets a solid foundation for the conversation and makes sure you do capture items that need to be celebrated. There will be rare cases where the person has nothing good to share… this should not be the norm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q1: What worked well?</p>
<p>Q2: How impactful was that to the (success/failure) of the effort?</p>
<p>Q3: how would you suggest we improve on that?</p>

<h2>
<a name=""simple-summary-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#simple-summary-1""></a>Simple Summary</h2>
<p>This proposal puts forward an opportunity for the community to engage with a law firm to set up a corporate structure. This corporate structure is designed to solve for a number of issues that DAOs face in general and Index Cooperative faces in particular.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""abstract-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#abstract-2""></a>Abstract</h2>
<p>Based upon Index Coop’s needs, Fried Frank has recommended a Cayman foundation structure that will likely have a British Virgin Islands (BVI) subsidiary in anticipation of any future Treasury diversifications. This approach has been vetted by a third party legal expert.</p>
<p>There are both upfront and ongoing costs if the community decides to move forward. The estimated Year 1 cost ranges between $107k and $204k, with yearly ongoing costs ranging from $30,500 to $67,500. We expect the corporate structure to take as little as 3-4 weeks to create and for Index Coop to use Fried Frank to do so.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""motivation-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#motivation-3""></a>Motivation</h2>
<p>As the Index Cooperative grows, we should pivot towards a formal organizational structure that is compliant and easier to work with. Top DeFi projects and protocols have gone down the path of formal incorporation. We argue that Index Cooperative should do the same. Having no corporate structure leaves us collectively more open to risks.</p>
<p>Incorporating Index Cooperative would have multiple benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating limited liability protection for contributors. Our current structure creates unnecessary risks that we should move immediately to mitigate or outright eliminate</li>
<li>Opening the door to more partnerships and off-chain activity with organizations that will only enter into a contract or engage with an actual legal entity</li>
<li>Compliance with applicable tax laws</li>
</ul>
<p>We have explored various incorporation options with the law firm Fried Frank to arrive at a recommended structure that serves Index Cooperative’s specific organizational needs and business model.</p>
<p>Prior to moving this IIP to vote, we intend to facilitate an open discussion with the broader community on this forum thread.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""specification-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#specification-4""></a>Specification</h2>
<p>Creating the proposed structure has both an upfront and ongoing cost. If the community decides to move forward, the estimated Year 1 cost ranges between $107k and $204k with an ongoing cost ranging from $30,500 to $67,500. A full breakdown of these anticipated costs can be found <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lIfQJkHF_rzVac8OdA6s-QX_w3SfBZri_ORHckvYSYI/edit#gid=0"">here <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""29 clicks"">29</span></a>.</p>
<p>Do note that some of the estimated costs may not be required (and are earmarked as such) or may be satisfied in ways that do not incur the listed cost, so the overall costs may be lower. That said, it’s best to analyze the merits of this proposal assuming the high-end of the range.</p>
<p>Creating the corporate structure is anticipated to take around 3-4 weeks to set up. This will benefit all at the Index Coop through mitigating potential but unknown risks, protecting its members from personal liability. It also allows the Index Coop to become a compliant entity that is safer and easier for third parties to work and engage with.</p>

<a name=""summary-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#summary-1""></a>Summary</h2>
<p>As the Index Coop grows so does the number of governance proposals coming through our forum. Add to that each new product potentially adding more meta-governance votes, and the engagement required becomes exponential. This is highlighted in <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/increasing-community-governance-power/1580"">Increasing Governance Power <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""6 clicks"">6</span></a> and the table below, showing how four recent IIPs failed to meet quorum, and in the case of the ETH2x-FLI cap change, this resulted in a knock on effect that was felt by our end users. Having said that, failing to meet quorum within Index Coop has proved to be the exception not the rule so far.</p>

<p>Besides trying to address this specific issue, the ability to delegate votes should hopefully have the second order effect of distributing governance power more evenly throughout the community. Recent analysis showed that the top 3-4 INDEX holders have the power to sway most votes, lifting the long-tail of holders by combining voting power is designed to help even this out.</p>

<h2>
<a name=""proposed-solutions-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#proposed-solutions-2""></a>Proposed Solution(s)</h2>
<p>Long term it has been discussed that the Coop could incentivise governance and build out a portal to enable delegation and rewards for token stakers, this is far from confirmed and may not even be the right solution. In the interim however we have been able to set up our <a href=""https://snapshot.org/#/index-coop.eth"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">snapshot page <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""30 clicks"">30</span></a> such that we have full control over its parameters, and vote delegation has been switched on after passing <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-38-update-snapshot-strategy/1377"">IIP-38 <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""7 clicks"">7</span></a>. We recommend using vote delegation on Snapshot to help lift community voting power. This is by no means the end game when it comes to governance, but should help to increase token participation for IIPs and thus meeting quorum.</p>
<p>Alongside vote delegation, tokens from the strategic sale will be eligible to vote while still in the vesting contracts. This only helps us meet quorum if the strategic investors are actively involved in voting, as the tokens in circulation also increases, raising the hurdle to quorum proportionally.</p>

<li>
<p>Communicate your intention to become a delegate! You can use Twitter and the <span class=""hashtag"">#delegates</span> channel in Discord specifically for this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a concerted effort to vote as often as you can, having taken the time to understand what is being proposed and what effect it has on Index Coop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vote in alignment with your philosophy (if you put one forward).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not mandatory but consider sharing how you plan to vote prior to the vote concluding. This gives time for people to react if they don’t agree and demonstrates a level of care and understanding. <a href=""https://twitter.com/MonetSupply/status/1400548620345114625?s=20"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Monet.supply <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""8 clicks"">8</span></a> is a great example.</p>

<p><strong>Any security changes required?</strong> - the usual precautions apply, if you use a hardware wallet then continue to do so but there is no need to upgrade just for this. In the event your address is compromised you should communicate it via the tracking sheet and/or in Discord so that users can un-delegate from your address.</p>
<p><strong>I’m concerned about being doxxed</strong> - clearly any address you put forward will be tied to your persona. That means any on-chain transactions to other wallets can also be linked to you. We recommend setting up a new wallet if you are not comfortable with this, although that will obviously negate any voting history built up with another address.</p>

<p>In relation to the use and creation of subDAOs, The Index Coop Council stated "" <strong>The Council has decided that it is important to put specific definitions to the various entities within the Index Coop. The council would like to delegate this responsibility to Governance</strong>""</p>
<p>Following those instruction, the Governance Team researched, outlined, and presented for feedback the findings on how the creation of subDAOs would compare with our current Nest and Pod structure.  The summary of this information is captured in this  <a href=""https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10YHu2xDIYny7xYYg0iyO5unC2raTteAMThb7DhD-Q4M/edit#slide=id.g113b245154e_0_1"">slidedeck <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""3 clicks"">3</span></a> and a recording of this session is captured <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b3Ad0PtMKBRVvJPy1E6Mx07Ph12FGgQX/view?usp=sharing"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Governance team met with representatives from the ICC to outline the findings and to review a outline of an IIP proposal template - building a pathway to the creation of subDAOs, which can be found on <a href=""https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10YHu2xDIYny7xYYg0iyO5unC2raTteAMThb7DhD-Q4M/edit#slide=id.g12290198d8f_0_845"">slide</a>.</p>
<p>As an output to those discussions, the Governance Team proposes the following IIP template as a guideline for the proposal and creation of a subDAO within the Index Coop.</p>
<p>To note, this IIP template have been designed to fold into the existing <strong><a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-improvement-proposals-iip-process/4249"">Index Improvement Proposals (IIP) Process</a></strong>, following that end to end process.</p>

<a name=""mission-motivation-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#mission-motivation-4""></a>Mission / Motivation</h1>
<p><strong>Problem / Opportunity statement:</strong><br>
This section should describe the reason for creating the subDAO. Important points to highlight here include what quantifiable problem the proposed subDAO seeks to solve.  An example might look like “the subDAO will reduce the pod budget by 50% within one season”.  Alternatively, what quantifiable value will the subDAO create?  An example might include “the subDAO intends to generate $40K in excess revenue within 12 months of creation.  This section should include the initial KPI / OKRs the community can use to evaluate the subDAO</p>
<p>Community members should be able to evaluate this section critically and question general statements that will be difficult to evaluate, for example, a statement like “this subDAO will be faster and more efficient that the Nest model”.  That sounds good, but given the subDAO is evaluated each season, how will “faster and more efficient be evaluated?”.  A better example might be “this subDAO will bring products to market 20% faster than the Nest structure as measured from IIP approval to product launch - which is today xyz days /  weeks / months”.   To be fair, some OKR/KPIs may be best-guess estimates for a new business model or service.</p>
<p><strong>Services and Responsibilities:</strong><br>
If the subDAO is expected to provide some form of services to the superDAO (Index Coop DAO) or take on the responsibility of running a specified functional area of the superDAO. This part of the proposal should be used to clearly describe the services and responsibilities that the subDAO will provide (e.g accountability &amp; reporting). This is what will be done if the IIP passes, not why it should be done or how it will be done.</p>
<p>Community members should evaluate this section by looking for concrete deliverables that can be evaluated.  A good example might look like “the subDAO will deliver monthly financial reports at the same level of quality as being delivered today, but on a bi-monthly basis”.   A weaker example might look like “the subDAO will provide financial insights on a regular basis”.  Think in the context of “in six months, how can a contributor evaluate if this subDAO delivered on its promise”.</p>
<p><strong>External Services:</strong><br>
Is the subDAO intending to work externally by providing services to other organizations? If yes, what services will be offered, how will those services be marketed, and what is the rough timeline for offering those services?  Will offering those services conflict with services offered to the Index Coop? If external services cause mutually exclusive choices, how will those decisions be made?  In the proposers view, is there a potential for a conflict of interest? How should those be addressed and how would future conflict of interest cases be evaluated and managed?</p>
<p>If successful, how does the subDAO intend to share revenue with the superDAO? What would be the proposed split or revenue sharing model and what would be the potential profit targets where revenue sharing might be initiated.</p>
<h1>
<a name=""requirements-and-funding-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#requirements-and-funding-5""></a>Requirements and Funding</h1>
<p>It is expected that the subDAO will have some requirements from the superDAO. In order to ensure alignment between the subDAO and the superDAO, clearly communicate the <strong>services, tooling, human capital, and funding</strong> that will be required from the superDAO.</p>
<p><strong>Services</strong> include but are not limited to the various functions contained with the Nests and Pods of the Index Coop such as marketing / promotion, design, delegation, engineering, accounting, financial reporting, payroll, expense reimbursement, recruitment, governance infrastructure, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Tooling</strong> includes but is not limited to access / membership of any of the Index Coop’s technology and organizational stack, such as Notion, Discord, Dune Analytics, Discourse (Governance Forum), Google Suite, Snapshot, Twitter, YouTube, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Human Capital</strong> in this context refers to the use of retained Index Coop contributors who will assist the subDAO. It is helpful to be upfront about how the subDAO is expected to utilize talent from the superDAO. Think about and highlight any contributor who will spend part of their time on the subDAO - (sCoop writers for example).  This could include a rough time commitment, and if needed (or known) how this will affect their existing work at the superDAO.</p>
<p><strong>Funding</strong> is simply how much the Index Coop is requested to pay for the services that the subDAO will provide, and can include budget detail.  The request for funding will ideally follow the standard budgeting / planning cycle of the superDAO. This section should address if the subDAO is expecting to create / maintain a multisig.  Funding requests should include currency denominations as well (INDEX, vs., USDC).</p>
<p>Community members should evaluate this section in terms of clarity and completeness of the plan, as well as the difficulty of the work ahead for the subDAO.  Pay attention to the services the subDAO will need as well as superDAO contributors who will need to support the subDAO.   In relation to the budget, is the proposal going to be cost accretive, cost neutral, or cost reductive to the existing spend?</p>
<p><strong>subDAO Team / Personnel:</strong><br>
The subDAO can present a list of roles the subDAO intends to staff and at what capacity (Full Time / Part Time).  If funding is expected from the superDAO, it’s helpful to provide funding details for each role inclusive of ancillary expenses / income (DSM allocation, bonus, travel budget, etc.)</p>
<p>The leadership structure of the subDAO should also be highlighted i.e will there be a “leader” of the subDAO? Leadership can take any form or none at all, but <strong>a clear DRI is expected to be put forth</strong> to ensure clear communication between the subDAO and the superDAO. A <strong>Index Coop relationship touch point</strong> from the superDAO should also be proposed by the subDAO to ensure consistent communication with the superDAO.  The contact could be an existing Nest Lead, or ICC member - with thoughts into how changes might be addressed when people / roles change.</p>
<p>In relation to the roles the subDAO intends to staff, it’s may be helpful to provide funding details for each role inclusive of ancillary expenses / income (DSM allocation, bonus, travel budget, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Grant period and renewal process:</strong><br>
The ingoing position is that this process follows the standard Index Coop planning cycle, currently outlined by seasons.  This being the case, the base expectation is that request are placed for following seasons, with renewals / updates proposed with each successive season.  If this is process would be changed (annual funding, ongoing funding), a clarification as to why this might make sense would go here.  Otherwise - each season there would be an update to the proposal with a request for additional funding or update to revenue sharing model.</p>
<p><strong>subToken:</strong><br>
Does the subDAO intend on having its own token in the future? If yes, what is a proposed timeline and what might be the basic mechanics?  As the timeline moves closer, the details on the creation and linkage back to the INDEX token will need to be clarified</p>
<h1>
<a name=""decision-making-multisig-structure-6"" class=""anchor"" href=""#decision-making-multisig-structure-6""></a>Decision Making / Multisig Structure</h1>
<p><strong>Decision scope</strong><br>
Linking to the section above, depending on the leadership structure, how will the subDAO make important decisions? What decisions will the subDAO make?  What decisions are out of scope for the subDAO? How will the subDAO pass decisions over to the superDAO?  If a decision rights need to be clarified, how will that happen between the superDAO and the subDAO?</p>
<p><strong>Multisig</strong><br>
If the subDAO will have a multisig, to either hold any requested funds or carry out subDAO operations, who will be on the multi-sig? Who will be able to change the multi-sig assignments, and what is the proposed process for changing the multi-sig?  Will the superDAO have a say in who is on the multi sig?  Will the subDAO need a superDAO sign off for spend over a specific threshold?</p>
<h1>
<a name=""transition-discrepancies-plan-7"" class=""anchor"" href=""#transition-discrepancies-plan-7""></a>Transition &amp; Discrepancies Plan</h1>
<p>Is the subDAO being formed currently a Nest or Pod of the Index Coop DAO? What is the transition plan from the current state to a subDAO? What components will change, what components may stay the same?  How much time is required to make the transition?  Will all of the services be available on day 1 or will there need to be a transition plan.</p>
<p><strong>In case of Death or Divorce:</strong><br>
It is intended for subDAOs to be proposed / approved on a seasonal basis.  In the case that a successive season is not approved - and the subDAO is ejected or dissolved, if the subDAO provides necessary services to the superDAO - what might be required to unwind the relationship or port capabilities back over to the superDAO?  In rough terms, how would this process work and what might be some of the risks or issues associated with moving the work back into the DAO?</p>
<p>For community members - if the subDAO is providing a necessary service to the superDAO - if the relationship goes wrong, how will the superDAO rebuild or reabsorb capabilities to ensure ongoing operations of the Index Coop? Does the IC have the ability to rebuild the capability? Is there an outside service provider that could be asked to step in and replace the subDAO?  We all hope for an amicable relationship, but putting some thought into how a subDAO may be adding risk to the organization is prudent.</p>

<p>If you weren’t able to attend, this is a <strong>must watch</strong> as it explores a vision for how Index Coop could be structured going forward.</p>
<p>Instead of converting a 40+ slide deck into a forum post, I would encourage comments and feedback here based on a review of the slides and recording.</p>
<p>Given the broad consensus on both the problems and solutions, we are being specific in this post to enable the community to decide on our next steps with clarity.</p>
<p><strong>We’d like to acknowledge that implementing a new leadership structure within a DAO is uncomfortable.</strong></p>
<p>The goal of the proposed Wise Owls and Nests is not to create a hierarchical structure. Rather, it’s to enable more autonomous and decentralized entities to flourish with support from an effective system of emergent and elected stewardship. Great leadership empowers people to do their best work and reach new heights of success - this is what the proposed structure is designed to achieve.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""tldr-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#tldr-1""></a>TLDR</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Our governance structure has failed</strong> and contributors lack clarity and empowerment to make vital decisions at Index Coop. This means crucial decisions are not being made, are being made too slowly, and/or are being made without input from the proper stakeholders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To address these challenges, we introduced three new concepts. At the core of these concepts is the idea of delegated decision making. <strong>Pods</strong>, <strong>Nests</strong> and <strong>Wise Owls</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pods</strong> are the foundation of our organization. They are winning teams that have high trust in each other and deliver results in a specific area. They are agile and responsible for the success of a specific area of focus. Pods are flexible, can span across Nest and can vary in size and structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nests</strong> are made up of a network of Pods. Nests fund and support Pods within their broad area. Each Nest has between 3 and 7 elected “Nest Coordinators” who are the most trusted and high context individuals tasked with supporting the success of the Pods within their Nest. Nest could be considered Index Coop sub-DAOs. As Nests fund Pods, new Pods can be created and receive budget via discussion with Coordinator from a relevant Nest(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a temptation to try and be highly prescriptive around the remit and responsibilities of the Nest and Pods at this stage. Try and avoid this temptation. Support of this post is a directional commitment to establishing Nest and Pods as organizational units. The discussion on specific roles, responsibilities and structure be further solidified as we embark on launching each of the five Nest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wise Owls</strong> are a cross functional group tasked with addressing our most pressing decision-making needs <strong>which currently lack a clear owner</strong> our route to resolution. We a proposing an experiment to elect a temporary Wise Owls Council, composed of ~7 individuals with a term expiring Feb 28th.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The IIP process will continue to play an important role in our new structure as it will validate, confirm and approve Wise Owls, Nest Coordinators and Nest proposals and budgets (among other things)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Keep in mind, we are a leading DAO in the space, we are defining how to build contributor-led organizations.</strong></p>

<h2>
<a name=""responsibilities-of-wise-owls-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#responsibilities-of-wise-owls-3""></a>Responsibilities of Wise Owls</h2>
<p><strong>Over the last 6 months we have launched two new products with 7 million combined AUM. Currently, the biggest risk to Index Coop is not an abuse of power by our most trusted leaders - it’s not getting things done.</strong></p>
<p>As our autonomy has grown, increasingly we are seeing questions, challenges or situations arise where it is <strong>unclear who should make the final decision</strong>. This has led to <strong>organizational paralysis</strong> - with contributors not feeling empowered or able to address our most important challenges.</p>
<p>Wise Owls address this. They are tasked with <strong>proposing solutions</strong> to big decisions at Index Coop which <strong>currently lack a clear owner</strong>. Part of the solution is to identify who/what will be responsible for making this decision going forward.</p>
<p>This will enable the Wise Owls to continually address key issues as they arise, and then delegate responsibility to Pods or Nest(s). This is designed to help us avoid a heavy handed approach. Decision-making will begin at the Nest and Pod level, and if it becomes clear that an issue is intractable or system-critical, the Wise Owls will be tasked with the responsibility to develop a solution. To put it another way, the Wise Owls will focus on providing a first response for decisions that lack a clear owner, or which are so complex and cross-functional in nature they cannot be resolved by any other group.</p>
<p>Thus, Wise Owls are the <strong>tip of the spear</strong> ensuring Index Coop can rapidly respond to new situations as they arise. This will also be empowered to be Index Coops representatives to larger external stakeholders. This will create a new balance of power where Index Coop has equal voice at the table to Set and DFP.</p>
<p>Given that Wise Owls will only be in position until 28th of February, <strong>some example of decisions/activity</strong> the Wise Owls will make in the near term include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritisation of positions for FT hiring</li>
<li>Provided Q1 priorities to guide the creation of Nest</li>
<li>Determine funding for each Nest</li>
<li>Meeting bi-weekly with Set Labs</li>
<li>Determining the final Compensation &amp; Community Allocation structure proposed through IIP</li>
</ul>
<p>We think it is important to be careful to not look to create an exhaustive list of responsibilities for the Wise Owls now. The more enumerated the list, the harder it becomes for the Wise Owls to be truly successful. Moreover, we will likely get bogged down arguing about fringe cases - when there is a clear, undebatable need for Wise Owls to <strong>immediately</strong> address some of our most important and complex decision making challenges.</p>

<p>By giving the Wise Owls a clear mandate to act when decision-making on an issue exceeds the capacity of any one Pod or Nest, we can ensure the most pressing and challenging questions will be addressed head on. <strong>However, it is important the community and token holders can ensure the Wise Owls are kept accountable.</strong></p>

<li>A community poll calling for this action get +55% support, quorum 25 votes, poll open to Trust Level 1 OR</li>
<li>An IIP calling for this action gets over +55% support, quorum 7.5% of circulating supply</li>
</ul>
<p>This challenge can be called by ANY community member. Thus, Wise Owls will always be held to account.</p>

<a name=""election-mechanism-6"" class=""anchor"" href=""#election-mechanism-6""></a>Election mechanism</h2>
<p>The election mechanism for Wise Owls prompted some discussion. At this point, it is important to flag that <strong>no voting mechanism is perfect</strong>, that there will likely be dissatisfied people whichever system we choose. Thus, <strong>we must be able to disagree and commit</strong>.</p>
<p>We proposed a similar framework for the nomination and election of Wise Owls to one we have had success with in the past (<a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/the-funding-council-is-adding-1-new-member/2284/7"">Funding Council adding 1 new member <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""2 clicks"">2</span></a>, <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/formation-of-the-autonomy-kick-off-group/1988"">Formation of the Autonomy Kick Off Group <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""2 clicks"">2</span></a>)</p>
<h2>
<a name=""term-length-7"" class=""anchor"" href=""#term-length-7""></a>Term length</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wise Owls will be formally in place until the 28th Feb</li>
<li>After this point, the community can decide what should happen next (i.e. continue, refresh, disband). The assumption is Wise Owl <strong>will not</strong> continue to operate unless there is a clear desire for them to do so expressed by the community.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name=""how-many-positions-8"" class=""anchor"" href=""#how-many-positions-8""></a>How many positions?</h2>
<ul>
<li>5 “General” Wise Owls from across People Nest, Finance Nest, Growth Nest and Governance Nest</li>
<li>2 “Product” Wise Owls from T.Nest</li>
<li>This guarantees that we have the essential technical representation within the Wise Owls</li>
<li>A logical question given this approach may be <em>“if Technical Nest has two guaranteed spots, why not also provide a fixed number of spots to representatives from other Nests?”</em>
</li>
<li>We feel the success of the Wise Owls is best ensured if the group is composed of the most trusted and respected members of our community. This is best ensured by having a large number of positions open to a broader range of contributors. It also reduces the instances of Wise Owls being “shoehorned in” simply by virtue of them being from a smaller Nest (i.e. Governance vs Growth).</li>

<a name=""what-voting-system-will-we-use-9"" class=""anchor"" href=""#what-voting-system-will-we-use-9""></a>What voting system will we use?</h3>

<li>Bronze, Silver and Gold Owls are all eligible to participate. Silver Owls will get 2x vote weighting and Gold Owls will get a 4x vote weighting</li>

<a name=""alternative-systems-10"" class=""anchor"" href=""#alternative-systems-10""></a>Alternative systems</h2>
<p>It is important to remember there is no <strong>perfect election system</strong>. As such, we are keen to not get too bogged in an endless debate on the specifics of our nomination and election process. We believe the approach proposed above provides a simple method for standing up a fair, representative Wise Owls group which has broad community support.</p>
<p>During the call, some other alternative election mechanisms were proposed. To fairly assess them individually, more specific details would need to be provided. Some initial feedback on each has been provided below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Social token / NFT based voting</strong>
<ul>
<li>This idea offers some really intriguing opportunities, and I would definitely support further research into it. However, setting up robust NFT based voting framework is a 6 month+ project - and <strong>there is a need for the Wise Owls now</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Voting weights based on total contribution</strong>
<ul>
<li>The thinking behind this is interesting, as it looks to allocate more votes to highest context contributors as judged by historic reward</li>
<li>Using the data we have collected as part of the Comp work, we can see this has many practical issues. For example, Lemonade and myself would have <strong>comparable total votes to</strong>…</li>
<li>Cav (Product WGL), Pujimak (APAC WGL), Mel (Governance Ops WGL), Praifi (F.Nest contributor), Allan (FLI) and Ed (Engineering WGL) <strong>combined</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Electing Wise Owls in the way proposed does not mean alternative systems should not be explored and used. One of our “Decision Making Truth” is “<strong>we iterate, we experiment, we improve</strong>”. We fully expect the method of nomination for Wise Owls and Nest to evolve over time. There remit itself will also evolve, as Wise Owls will progressively work through challenging decisions that arise and propose a clear decision-maker going forward.</p>
<p>To support this evolution we propose the formation of a “Elections and Governance Pod” which will sit within the Governance Nest. This group will work to further research alternative election and nomination processes so future nomination processes for the Wise Owls and Nest Coordinators can be conducted in the best way possible. <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/mel.eth"">@mel.eth</a> , <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/lavi"">@Lavi</a> , <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/sixtykeys"">@sixtykeys</a>  <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/lemonadealpha"">@LemonadeAlpha</a> , <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/abel"">@Abel</a>, <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/mrmadila"">@MrMadila</a> it would be AWESOME to have your thinking to drive this conversation forward.</p>

<ul>
<li>Set overarching strategic direction</li>
<li>Allocate resources and capital to best support strategy</li>
<li>Ensure Nests are accountable for delivering on strategy</li>
<li>Delegate decisions which lack a clear owner to win teams</li>
</ul>
<p>We discussed three different models for how this could be achieved. These <a href=""https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JIhhCKC-HzxfUk0GdVSXTDnZtjuopoKJwXjC-D7WET4/edit#slide=id.gb6e33d0f6a_0_77"">slides <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""5 clicks"">5</span></a> summarize the pros and cons of each approach.</p>

<p>After discussion, it seemed that the general community sentiment was strongly in favor of continuing with a V2 of the Index Council in comparison to other alternative decision-making frameworks.</p>
<p>However, we also recognized the need for any future iteration of the Council to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve transparency and communication</li>
<li>More clearly define the remit and decision making power of the Index Council</li>
<li>Be better at delegating decision making responsibility to high context “win teams”</li>
</ul>
<p>This proposal seeks to move the conversation forward on this important topic.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""index-council-v2-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#index-council-v2-4""></a>Index Council V2</h2>
<p>For the next iterations, the Index Council will be laser-focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determining Index Coop strategy - especially relating to product and strategic partnerships</li>
<li>Supporting Resource allocation to deliver on our strategy.</li>
<li>Delegation decisions that lack a clear owner and empower “win teams” to solve problems</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the next iteration of the Index Council could almost be seen as a “<strong>Resource Allocation and Strategy Pod</strong>” (RASP). It is worth highlighting that whilst the Index Council may be the ultimate “approver” of some decisions, in most instances another group will be “recommending” and/or drive activity on a particular topic.</p>
<p>This framework for how Index Coop will handle decisions in Season 1 can be seen as follows:</p>

</div><p>Syncing the cycles of Index Council with our Seasons, we see new Council members will be appointed either 1-month after the start, or 1-month before the end of each season. This enables any new Council member to be involved in the entire lifecycle of a Season and play a critical role in shaping Index Coops Seasonal strategy.</p>

<a name=""compensation-6"" class=""anchor"" href=""#compensation-6""></a>Compensation</h2>
<p>To provide clarity on Council compensation, all members elected to the Council will move to <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-128-priority-hiring-round-1/3707"">Band 6 <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""14 clicks"">14</span></a> as per our priority hiring guidelines. If a Council member’s compensation is higher than the Band 6 level, no additional compensation will be provided.</p>
<p>Providing additional compensation for Council service is intended to incentivize running for Council and actively contributing.</p>
<p>Council members will return to their previous compensation Band when they no longer serve on the Council.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""council-processes-7"" class=""anchor"" href=""#council-processes-7""></a>Council Processes</h2>
<p>In V1 of the Council, we reflected on the need to improve the transparency, efficiency and effectiveness of Council processes. We are also striving to delegate more actively to contributors and increase decentralization.</p>
<p>Towards the aims of transparency and efficiency, we are introducing Council meeting agenda, minutes and roles. Additionally, we are introducing a Council agenda queue to give more visibility on pending agenda topics, as well as a channel for contributors to propose and prioritize agenda topics.</p>
<p>Ahead of every meeting the Council Secretary (described below) will complete and circulate the meeting agenda according to this <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zReNH1XlpOyFtwR3H2uE5Ww2nCpypotP7aAlknxMEpQ/edit#"">template. <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""5 clicks"">5</span></a> The agenda is intended to focus the discussion on topics within the Council’s remit and to focus on decision-making. The agenda will be distributed on the contributor Discord.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Council will distribute meeting minutes according to this <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gkbDNLnhRmTMZ6NNwYWA5O29WXUQx9GwMRaCEMFVaeg/"">template <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""3 clicks"">3</span></a>. The purpose of the minutes is to provide transparency as well as a record of decisions. There may be occasions where the Council needs to discuss sensitive topics in which case some content may be appropriately redacted. The minutes will be distributed to contributors in the contributor’s Discord.</p>
<p>Finally, we are introducing the <a href=""https://www.notion.so/index-coop/08a5c9e4a16e4fb09d1317ab756d2132?v=d6e666deabd64256aff4f71d4f70a262"">Council Agenda Queue <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a> which gives full transparency on pending agenda topics, as well as a mechanism for contributors to propose and prioritize agenda topics. The agenda queue is a new platform that provides a way for contributors to raise potential agenda topics as well as to upvote topics they consider important. The Council Secretary will be responsible for managing the agenda queue and working with the Council Steward (described below) to get prioritized topics onto the agenda. It is important to note that the agenda queue has a means to label topics out of the Council’s scope as well as to delegate decisions back to contributors. Both mechanisms are intended to focus the council on topics squarely within its remit and to actively promote contributor empowerment and decentralization.</p>

<p>A big thank you to <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/iluscavia"">@iluscavia</a> for architecting this framework and spending the many hours needed to build out a robust proposal for your consideration.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""summary-of-proposal-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#summary-of-proposal-1""></a>Summary of Proposal</h3>
<p>The Index Coop DAO would benefit from strengthening the role of the Funding Council to ensure a laser-focused strategy, appropriate resourcing, and responsible use of funds.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""the-challenge-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#the-challenge-2""></a>The challenge</h3>
<p>In keeping with the ethos of a DAO, Index Coop’s (Index) current structure is best described as a loose aggregation of disparate working groups (WG).</p>
<p>Each WG is largely self-contained, possessing individual leadership teams and contributing members, and operating independently, albeit with frequent touch points and communication with other WGs.</p>
<p>To date, unfortunately, this increase in complexity has not led to a significantly different approach taken by the WGs. Subtle nuances and divergences are beginning to emerge, especially around the transparency of WGs and in particular about KPIs, budgets,success metrics and contributor compensation</p>
<p>This emerging challenge risks fracturing a strong community and alienating new joiners if there are no clearly stated, and measurable, standards to govern token disbursements in support of DAO-wide objectives.</p>
<p>Our Working Groups are responsible for Index’s current and past successes. However, in their current form this structure does not optimize Index Coop future success and scale. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accountability metrics
<ul>
<li>Lack of clarity on key KPIs to validate WGs success</li>
<li>No clearly identified deliverables dates for when key milestones will be achieved</li>
<li>There is no clear definition of what “success looks like”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Over-reliance on WG Leaders to provider review and challenge on proposals
<ul>
<li>To use their limited time to provide robust feedback on new WG proposals</li>
<li>To handle operational nuances associated with achieving KPIs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Weak budgeting
<ul>
<li>The diverse background of our Work Group Leads mean they have differing levels of experience producing detailed budgetary forecasts</li>
<li>This means that budgets may lack specifics or clarity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In a sense, Index is a victim of its own success, and this means that it must do what the crypto ecosystem does best, it must adapt to a changing environment in order to secure its future.</p>
<p>In short, without a group explicitly tasked with maintaining a set of standards and measuring KPIs to hold the WGs’ budgets accountable to the community, the DAO’s hitherto effectiveness is in jeopardy.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""background-on-funding-council-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#background-on-funding-council-3""></a>Background on Funding Council</h3>
<p>As many are aware, the DAO has a very important and central function fulfilled by the Funding Council (FC).</p>
<p>This group has the distinction of being responsible for mission critical elements including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Planning, executing, verifying monthly rewards distribution</li>
<li>Reviewing and settling reward disputes</li>
<li>Reviewing other proposals that come before the FC</li>
<li>Improving the FC budgeting process</li>
<li>Drafting subsequent Funding Council Grants</li>
</ul>
<p>They have also provided some support in areas including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving the Working Group structure &amp; process</li>
<li>Supporting Working Group leaders</li>
<li>Reviewing Working Group proposals</li>
</ul>
<p>These tenets have been critical to the creation and implementation of <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/working-groups-v1-1/1824"">Working Groups v1.1 <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""2 clicks"">2</span></a>, which aims to increase autonomy and accountability within working groups.</p>
<p>By implementation a “cost centre” model (see the last FC grant request <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ADMzRLt6sn8mZGwE2FEGwccqFzKfXyVA6c-3SCnf6fk/edit#gid=1476709866"">here <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""2 clicks"">2</span></a>) we have seen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greater autonomy for WGLs determine contributor rewards for their teams</li>
<li>Increased efficiency and reduced risk as “payroll” is run centrally through the FC</li>
<li>Greater transparency and accountability of spend for Working Groups</li>
</ul>
<p>Recent changes to the Funding Council have meant Working Groups have moved to a “cost centre” model. This means Working Groups have set budgets - and their associated spend (both contributor and otherwise) is tracked and reported.</p>
<p>This means Working Group leads set the reward for individuals completing activity for their areas whilst the Funding Council processes the payment and provides light touch oversight.</p>
<p>While the above are steps in the right direction, we can improve.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""solution-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#solution-4""></a>Solution</h3>
<p>Given the above responsibilities, we propose an expansion of the FC’s remit to focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>KPIs
<ul>
<li>Work with and support WGs to establish and measure KPIs in conjunction with the WGLs</li>
<li>Expansion to Working Group template to include KPIs, deliverables and success metrics</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Budget
<ul>
<li>Work with and support WGs developing robust budgets and execution timelines against its stated plan</li>
<li>Standardize a budget template for community use prior to advancing to IIP stage</li>
<li>Expansion of contributor reward form to include hours worked and expected reward</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Accountability
<ul>
<li>Coordinate WG proposal presentations to provide the community an open forum to ask questions and provide challenges</li>
<li>Provide detailed analyses, feedback and challenge on WG proposals. Provide an ultimate budgetary rating and recommendation (support/not support) on a particular proposal.</li>
<li>This recommendation would not prevent WG proposal going to IIP. However, it would provide the community in depth insight into the value of a proposal as assessed by an experienced team.</li>
<li>This recommendation is made by a group (the finding Council) which they themselves has appointed to ensure rapid growth and prudent financial management in line with our North Stars.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rewards
<ul>
<li>Introduce new mechanisms to ensure contributor rewards better compensate key coop contributors. This may include:
<ul>
<li>Opportunity for non-WGLs to take Index denominated rewards</li>
<li>Opportunity for non-WGLs to take on fixed rewards</li>
<li>Opportunity for contributors to choose to forgo their reward now to receive an additional reward % in vested tokens</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Establishing and measuring KPIs, in order to hold the WGs, and the DAO as a whole accountable, are arguably the most significant of these enhancements. This added responsibility includes validating that KPIs are set and met for each round of funding disbursed by the FC. This more robust approach also ensures that the FC will be able to defend funding decisions if questioned or audited, which, in light of increasing demand for existing products, entails more funding decisions.</p>
<p>In short, this proposal seeks to expand and formalize the responsibilities of the FC in order to better serve the mission of the Index DAO.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""implementation-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#implementation-5""></a>Implementation</h3>
<p>In order to achieve the above, ambitious plan, we recommend these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Introduce a new WG budget template which clearly outlines KPIs, success criteria and deliverables</p>
<ul>
<li>FC and Treasury WG to determine new format</li>
<li>Recommended enhancements could include:
<ul>
<li>Summary description of proposal objectives/goals (150 words max)</li>
<li>Summary table of measurable KPIs and success criteria</li>
<li>List of names of the sponsors
<ul>
<li>WGL(s)</li>
<li>FC reviewer(s)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Detailed list of milestones and key deliverables</li>
<li>Prioritisation and use of funds</li>
<li>Table with budgetary flow of funds</li>
<li>Range of acceptable outcomes
<ul>
<li>Conservative, minimum definition of success</li>
<li>Expected, base assumption definition of success</li>
<li>Aggressive, unexpected (everything goes better than expected) definition of success</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Risks to budget</li>
<li>Risks to outcome</li>
<li>Recommendation (to be completed by FC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appoint a WG Budget Aid to support WGLs in working through and proposing a detailed budget that complies with new standards</p>
<ul>
<li>WG budget-aid to be compensated by provided by the Funding Council - this approach is designed to relieve pressure on the WGLs and support them to adopt best practices quickly and with minimal effort develop a robust budget for their area.</li>
<li>Recommended compensation of $55/hour/budget proposal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Presently all WGs are approved and funded by the Funding Council, which in turn receive funding via a single IIP (<a href=""https://snapshot.org/#/index-coop.eth/proposal/QmdqUd3RrPxoxQK8PgD1DbcifNrvd5hFWhY1T5Mcu2bMJa"">IIP-59: Funding Council Grant #4 <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""2 clicks"">2</span></a>). In future, WG would each separately take their proposal to IIP so the community could ultimately decide on which WGs to support - using the recommendation of the Funding Council (support/not-support) to inform their decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In instances where a Working Group proposal does not pass, the Funding Council would take a proactive role in coordinating and funding contributors in the interim whilst a solution is found (as we saw with Language Ops in August).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Framework for Funding Council to assign a “rating” for working group proposals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each component of the budget receives a rating on a scale of 0-5
<ul>
<li>A score of 0 = missing</li>
<li>A score of 1 = superficial/cursory completion</li>
<li>A score of 2 = needs improvement</li>
<li>A score of 3 = adequate/meets minimum standard</li>
<li>A score of 4 = provides additional detail to assist analysis</li>
<li>A score of 5 = exemplary level of detail and clarity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These ratings will assist in reaching a support/not support recommendation
<ul>
<li>At a minimum, sum-total of component scores need to = ## (# components *3)</li>
<li>Qualitative analysis/assessment can influence aggregate score no more than 3 points positively or negatively (+/- 3 variance)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appointment of a direct “payment processing support role” to assist in the treasury rewards process ($1,500 stipend per month)</p>
<ul>
<li>This support function is funded by the Funding Council. Responsibilities include:
<ul>
<li>Collection and processing of contributor rewards sheet</li>
<li>Day to day management of contributor rewards process and coordination with stakeholders</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appointment of a WG Budget Aid ($1500 base and additional $700 per WG budget produced)</p>
<ul>
<li>A job role for a WG Budget Aid is currently being drafted, broad responsibilities will include:
<ul>
<li>Developing new budgetary templates and tools</li>
<li>Directly supporting WGLs to produce a quarterly budget and formal WG proposal</li>
<li>Reviewing and validating formal Working Group proposals</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<a name=""simple-summary-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#simple-summary-1""></a>Simple Summary</h1>
<p>This IIP is to approve the budgeting for Season 1 (Feb 1st to June 30th) operations of the Index Coop. Given the gravity of the proposal, we feel it appropriate to take this through IIP cementing the direction to progressively move towards a more refined and efficient business model. The budgets for each Nest have been approved by both Finance Nest and the Index Council. During Season 1 there is an overall <strong>10.72%</strong> reduction on Actual Q4 average monthly spend. We believe this to be a positive move towards a leaner business model that is both able to grow and deliver results for the community.</p>

<p>We are mindful that a lack of clear progression path for contributors (owl levels) over the past few months has caused some confusion and frustration. Moving into Season 1 with more alignment on overarching objectives and clear objective-focused projects for each Nest, we can now define the S1 Owl Levels, the process we took to set Owl Levels and the new progression and regression framework.</p>
<p>This document is focused specifically toward those contributors nominated by Nests as part of their Season 1 proposal. We will continue to iterate and improve this process throughout the Season with contributor feedback.</p>

<h2>
<a name=""challenges-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#challenges-1""></a>Challenges</h2>
<p>Toward the end of last year we hosted a number of Owl Level workshops. The major concerns raised by the community included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Centralisation risk where Owl Levels are determined by only a small group of individuals</li>
<li>Owl Levels being directly associated with monthly compensation</li>
<li>Regression and offboarding</li>
<li>Consistency (owl levels for contributors spread across multiple Nests)</li>
</ul>
<p>With these concerns top of mind, we’ve designed a bottoms up approach where Nests have proposed the names of contributors as part of their Season 1 proposal. The Index Council then reviewed and approved the proposed Owl Levels as part of each Nests’ proposal. On an ongoing basis, Nests may propose individual changes to Owl Levels. New Bronze Owls, or owl level regression happens at the Nests discretion. Progressions of Gold or Silver Owls are approved by the Index Council.</p>
<p>Given that now each proposal has provided a final list of Owls across all Nests - we are now in a position to move forward with an IIP to expand DSM access to contributors outside of the Priority Hires.</p>
<p>This is by no means a perfect solution. There are tradeoffs. We will continue to iterate on this process and move it toward the most decentralised, transparent, fair and efficient framework possible.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""how-do-contributors-progress-through-the-owl-levels-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#how-do-contributors-progress-through-the-owl-levels-2""></a>How do contributors progress through the Owl Levels?</h3>
<p>Throughout the Season, each Nest can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Propose progression of owls to Silver or Gold Owl levels</li>
<li>Regress owls to lower owl levels</li>
<li>Assign new contributors a Bronze Owl level</li>
</ul>
<p>Initially, we are proposing that Silver and Gold Owl progressions are reviewed by the Index Council to ensure consistency across Nests. Bronze Owls can be allocated at the Nests discretion. We welcome ideas/suggestions to iterate and improve on this process throughout Season 1.</p>
<p>We had initially planned for each Nest to propose a number of “spare” Owl levels within their Season proposal. This would have given autonomy for Nests to change Owl Levels inflight without the need for further approval. However, we weren’t able to organise all Nests to propose the spare owl levels prior to proposals being published. We intend to develop a more decentralised, nest-driven owl level progression framework throughout Season 1.</p>
<p>Regardless of the method used to progress, regress or assign owl roles, we should be focusing on impact driving the Nest toward its overarching goals and objectives.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""what-do-the-different-owl-levels-unlock-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#what-do-the-different-owl-levels-unlock-3""></a>What do the different owl levels unlock?</h3>
<h4>
<a name=""tooling-access-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#tooling-access-4""></a>Tooling access</h4>
<p>As the DAO grows, we’re looking for more efficient ways to determine levels of trust. Higher owl levels will be given access and logins to the different tools/platforms we use. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notion access</li>
<li>Google Account</li>
<li>Miro</li>
</ul>
<p>By defining the active contributors in Index Coop, it also enables the operations pod to automate the process of tooling access and remove (and not pay for) contributors to have accounts they are no longer actively using.</p>
<h4>
<a name=""compensation-benefits-and-the-dsm-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#compensation-benefits-and-the-dsm-5""></a>Compensation, benefits and the DSM</h4>
<p>While we don’t want to tie compensation directly to Owl Levels, we are continually seeking a more decentralised alternative to distribute compensation. A single Nest Coordinator determining compensation is both inefficient and leads to unnecessary tension. Higher owl levels should indicate higher impact and context.</p>
<p>In Community Nest, we are using owl levels to decentralise compensation decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using Coordinape as our compensation tool, each contributor has their $GIVE allocations weighted via Owl Levels. Bronze Owls have 100 $GIVE tokens, Silver 200, Gold 300. This decentralises compensation while ensuring the Owls with the highest levels of context have the highest $GIVE to distribute. <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/flexible-contributor-rewards-2-0/3848"">More information here <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""2 clicks"">2</span></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are hopeful over time this model may be adopted by other Nests. Moreover, in time we hope Owl Levels can be used to provide contributors with budget for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Training &amp; upskilling</li>
<li>Travel and conferences</li>
<li>Expenses</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, by confirming Owl Levels, we are also hopeful we can expand Dynamic Staking Model access to a wider group of contributors. This would give contributors the ability to earn yield on the $INDEX tokens they hold and incentivise increased retention and greater community ownership. We will seek to take a formal DSM expansion proposal through IIP over the coming weeks.</p>
<h4>
<a name=""governance-and-weighted-voting-6"" class=""anchor"" href=""#governance-and-weighted-voting-6""></a>Governance and weighted voting</h4>
<p>The Coop is currently experimenting with weighted voting based on Owl Levels to ensure those contributors with the highest levels of context are given a proportional influence on decision making. This forms a rudimentary “reputation based voting” which we expect to evolve over time (i.e. through the use of vote weighted NFTs).</p>
<p>This is the first formal iteration of owl level progression, with the communities feedback and exploration of alternative governance models, we expect our framework for owl levels to evolve over time.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/anthonyb.eth"">@anthonyb.eth</a> for kicking off the first Governance Enhancement workshop today.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""how-do-we-ensure-owl-level-consistency-across-nests-7"" class=""anchor"" href=""#how-do-we-ensure-owl-level-consistency-across-nests-7""></a>How do we ensure owl level consistency across Nests?</h3>
<p>While each Nest has the flexibility to determine how they approach owl levels, we do want to ensure we’re maintaining some consistency between Nests. The owl level progression framework shared below is designed to help guide each Nest’s Owl Level allocation, progression and regression decisions within the guardrails of the broader coop.</p>
<p>Having said this, we do understand each Nest is different. We look forward to the development of a number of unique Nest progression manifestos.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""how-do-we-approach-regression-and-offboarding-8"" class=""anchor"" href=""#how-do-we-approach-regression-and-offboarding-8""></a>How do we approach regression and offboarding?</h3>
<p>Not an easy topic. Community Nest and HC pod will be working to develop a more robust regression and offboarding framework over the course of Season 1. Both Nests and the Index Council will have the autonomy to identify and regress owl levels due to ongoing underperformance or misalignment with the team. We are encouraging Nests to decentralize regression where possible. Coordinape is a great tool to help inform this!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Community Nest will again be using Coordinape to facilitate collective regression decisions. Any owls with $GIVE allocations significantly underperforming other owls at the same level will be engaged by the Nest to understand any potential misalignments, unrecognized contributions and opportunities for continued improvements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any serious misalignment external to performance concerns (breaches of code of conduct, ongoing conflict) should be approached through the formal offboarding process. This will involve opening lines of communication to understand any potential misalignments, identifying opportunities for rectification of behavior and continued improvements.</p>

<a name=""season-1-owl-levels-11"" class=""anchor"" href=""#season-1-owl-levels-11""></a>Season 1 Owl Levels</h2>
<p>Going forward, Owl Levels will be continually readjusted via the process outlined in this document. To start the process, in Season 1 Owl Levels were set using the following process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each Nest proposed the breakdown of Gold, Silver and Bronze contributors for their Nest as part of the proposal process</li>
<li>The Index Council reviewed and approved this list if proposed contributors</li>
<li>The highest Owl Level was taken for contributors who supported across multiple Nests</li>
</ul>
<p>The breakdown for Owl Levels in Season 1 can be seen below:</p>
<p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fXPnPH2vH5fiOIBLLQhucwCtzHp53sRr0-GhVugTUL8/edit?usp=sharing"">Season 1 Owl Levels. <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""28 clicks"">28</span></a></p>
<p>It is worth highlighting the inclusion of both Gold and Gold+ Owl Levels within the document. Gold and Gold+ owls should be considered broadly identical in regards to their levels of impact and position of trust within the organisation. The “+” indicates that the contributor has been taken through the priority hiring process.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""next-steps-12"" class=""anchor"" href=""#next-steps-12""></a>Next Steps</h2>
<p>Using the framework above as a guiding template to ensure some consistency, we’d encourage each Nest to think about ways to collectively co-create their own process and pathway for owl level progression if it makes sense to do so. For any bronze owl assignments, CNest can update Discord roles and internal databases, please contact <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/bradwmorris"">@bradwmorris</a> <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/0xmitz"">@0xMitz</a> <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/coolhorsegirl"">@coolhorsegirl</a> <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/kindeagle"">@kindeagle</a>. For Silver and Bronze Owl progressions, Nest coordinators/Nests can communicate progressions to the Index Council.</p>
<p>We understand this isn’t overly prescriptive or formal, we do expect to optimise the progression path over time once we’ve collected feedback.</p>
<p>Community Nest is available to help with Coordinape implementations.</p>
<p>We welcome feedback, comments or thoughts on the proposed framework - and ideas for how this can be further iterated in Season 1 and beyond would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<a name=""background-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#background-1""></a>Background</h2>
<p>On 22 October as part of Index 2.0, the Compensation and Community Ownership group published a <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/compensation-community-ownership-next-steps/3000"">post outlining <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""15 clicks"">15</span></a> a path forward to address the challenges our community faces around talent attraction, retention, and community ownership.</p>
<p>This was followed up by three separate posts on 12 November expanding on how a <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/community-ownership-retroactive-airdrop-to-historical-contributors/3199/19"">Retroactive Airdrop (1) <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""25 clicks"">25</span></a>, <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/compensation-v2-fixed-salary-hiring-guidelines/3196"">Priority Hiring Guidelines (2)</a> and <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/community-ownership-dynamic-staking-model/3198"">Dynamic Staking Model (3) <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""49 clicks"">49</span></a> could address these challenges.</p>
<p>Since sharing these posts we have received a range of caring and considered feedback from the Community, Investors, and Set.</p>
<p>This post provides a condensed summary (okay we tried!) of an updated V2 framework that covers the following core components of our compensation and community ownership work:</p>

<a name=""h-1-principles-of-a-successful-community-ownership-and-compensation-model-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#h-1-principles-of-a-successful-community-ownership-and-compensation-model-2""></a>1. Principles of a successful Community Ownership and Compensation model</h2>
<p>To ensure our approach is robust, we note the following core principles a successful model for Community Ownership needs to respect.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reward high impact contributors and leaders</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Competition for great people is white-hot. We must ensure that our high impact contributors are rewarded sufficiently and retained</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide flexibility and fairness guaranteeing new and existing contributors a fair opportunity to build ownership in the protocol</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We have seen the tension created by an “in” or “out” mindset when full-time compensation packages are the only meaningful path to contributor ownership. We must look to promote community ownership in a scalable, open and (as far as possible) permissionless way that unites contributors of all stripes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Align contributors’ incentives with long-term price appreciation of the INDEX token</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Presently, contributors receive more INDEX per month if INDEX prices depreciate. This is a counterproductive incentive framework that rewards contributors if INDEX price goes down. A new ownership system should align all contributors’ incentives with INDEX price appreciation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Incentivise contributors to hold INDEX</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To achieve sustainable community ownership, distributing tokens is not enough; we need to encourage contributors to hold their INDEX tokens</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Allocate tokens in a way that does not impede INDEX price discovery</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Index Coop’s continued operations are enabled through the value of the INDEX token. As responsible stewards of the community, we must ensure that any changes we implement avoid under sell pressure to ensure a sustainable INDEX price.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name=""h-2-community-feedback-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#h-2-community-feedback-3""></a>2. Community feedback</h2>
<p>We received a broad range of feedback on the original proposals, both in public and private. Several common themes emerged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Total Community Allocation felt too high (y1-y4)</li>
<li>Compensation may not adequately incentivize leadership and/or highest impact core contributors</li>
<li>Compensation may not encourage a long-term mindset (i.e. through lack of long-term vesting)</li>
<li>Challenge as to whether the community had “earned” such a generous community allocation - and whether Index Coop needed to demonstrate more success before contributors receive significant community ownership.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Airdrop</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Airdrop % allocation felt too high (y0-y1)</li>
<li>Airdrop would not adequately reward active contributors fairly in comparison to those who are no longer active</li>
<li>The new compensation framework, especially the airdrop, unfairly treats existing full-time contributors. This was primarily due to the fact that those on full-time packages would receive a smaller airdrop package and would face worse liquidity profiles on their FT package in comparison to the airdrop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic Staking Model</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Dynamic Staking Model was too complex, especially for new hires who require some certainty when considering whether to accept an offer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name=""h-3-summary-of-compensation-community-ownership-model-v2-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#h-3-summary-of-compensation-community-ownership-model-v2-4""></a>3. Summary of Compensation &amp; Community Ownership model V2</h2>
<p>Based on this feedback, we would like to present the following V2 revised compensation and community ownership model for consideration.</p>
<p>We propose:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>1.5% of total supply</strong> to cover historic contribution from Y0-Y1</li>
<li>
<strong>5% of total supply</strong> to be ring-fenced for future distribution in Y1 (starting Jan 2022)</li>
<li>
<strong>16% of total supply</strong> to be targeted for community distribution over Y2, Y3, Y4 etc. With the amount allocated to be determined by the Index Council each year based on current market conditions, treasury health etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>By moving away from a fixed yearly ownership distribution (i.e. Y2=4%, Y3=4%) towards a target overall percentage of 16% for years 2+, we feel better equipped to achieve long term community ownership whilst <strong>retaining the flexibility to adapt and readjust as we go</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>This 16% could be used to compensate contributors, and/or our community at large (i.e. holders of our products).</strong></p>

</div><h2>
<a name=""h-4-vest-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#h-4-vest-5""></a>4. Vest</h2>
<p>The timeline for when community allocation is received is a pivotal topic for success. In Web 2, vesting contracts have traditionally been used as “Golden Handcuffs” to incentivize long term alignment and retention.</p>
<p>We apply a similar principle to how we deliver community ownership under this model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under the <strong>Dynamic Staking Model</strong>, rewards earned in a given month will vest in full after 6 months and be distributed only if the contributor remained active within the community during that time. This means rewards earned in Jan 2022 via the DSM will be awarded in July 2022 if the contributor is still active.</li>
<li>Under the 1.5% <strong>community airdrop</strong>, we are proposing that the reward amount unlock linearly over 6 months. Vesting requirements of rewards from the airdrop will only be applied for those currently on FT contracts, to prevent receipt of airdrop and jumping to another opportunity</li>
<li>If a contributor ceases all activity with Index Coop - as defined as two months of no rewards from normal contribution - they will not earn any further rewards through the DSM and will also forfeit any of their unvested tokens</li>

<p>The forward-looking <strong>Dynamic Staking Model encourages contributors’ long term commitment to Index Coop</strong> and will provide a powerful incentive for retention. The airdrop <strong>acknowledges past contributors for value created</strong> and makes up for a failure by Index Coop to increase ownership for many high impact contributors who should have been transitioned onto a Full Time package many months ago (and have been patiently waiting whilst we figure all of this out).</p>
<p>By having the DSM rewards start after the airdrop rewards have been paid, we reduce sell pressure of INDEX and incentivise contributors to keep their airdrop rewards to build additional ownership and thus earn more through the Dynamic Staking Model.</p>
<p>The below diagram helps illustrate how this works in practice. It also helps us understand that under the current proposal, due to time lock and vesting, contributors <strong>would not</strong> be able to receive airdrop rewards and Dynamic Staking Model rewards simultaneously.</p>

<p>Similarly, if a contributor <strong>ceased to be active</strong> within Index Coop in November 2022, they would <strong>forgo 6 months of Dynamic Staking Model rewards</strong> earned during their time working at Index Coop. This introduces a powerful incentive for contributors to commit to the long term at Index Coop.</p>

<p>In contrast to our existing Full Time package, the DSM is more generous for any contributors looking to stay with Index Coop over the longer time horizon of 2+ years. It is significantly less generous for contributors looking to leave in the next 18 months or earlier.</p>
<p>As such it provides more incentive for longer-term alignment than our current FT packages. It is also more transparent and permissionless - anyone can become an Owl Level, hold INDEX in their wallet and engage with the DSM over years without having to deal with HR or some compensation committee ever.</p>
<p>In many ways, the vesting mechanism of the DSM could be seen as an <strong>adaptation of a more traditional multi-year vesting contract with a 6 month cliff</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Total Community Allocation - The number of tokens we aim to deliver to the community to cover y0-y4.</li>
<li>Allocation retention rate - The % of tokens that are retained by recipients and which are not sold.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Dynamic Staking Model (DSM) is designed to deliver a fixed % of INDEX to contributors each year. It is only available to white list contributors with a minimum Owl Level of Bronze and has an APY/return determined by a contributors’:</p>
<ul>
<li>Impact (Owl Level)</li>
<li>Tokens held in wallet</li>
</ul>
<p>As we know, commitment and contribution take different forms; most commonly, these are categorized under Talent, Treasure and Time. We have created a model designed to incentivize contributors to increase the impact of their participation (talent), while at the same time incentivizing them to increase their ownership of INDEX tokens (treasure) over a longer time frame (time).</p>
<h3>
<a name=""h-52-impact-owls-levels-8"" class=""anchor"" href=""#h-52-impact-owls-levels-8""></a>5.2 Impact (Owls Levels)</h3>
<p>In the model, more impactful contributions, as reflected by higher Owl Levels, are rewarded by a higher staking reward. The rationale behind this mechanism is that meaningful contributions receive a higher Owl Level (impact tier) and so should receive a greater reward.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""h-53-tokens-9"" class=""anchor"" href=""#h-53-tokens-9""></a>5.3 Tokens</h3>
<p>At the same time, a higher financial commitment to Index through large token holdings (skin in the game) is also rewarded. This concept is one that aligns the financial interests of contributors with those of INDEX holders at large. Let’s incentivize Owls to hold their stock in the family business, so to speak.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""h-54-dynamic-staking-model-10"" class=""anchor"" href=""#h-54-dynamic-staking-model-10""></a>5.4 “Dynamic” Staking Model</h3>
<p>More details and worked examples of the dynamic staking model are <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/community-ownership-dynamic-staking-model/3198"">shown here <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""49 clicks"">49</span></a>. In summary, the DSM is effective at building community ownership because it rewards contributors whose incentives are most aligned with the overall community. It does this by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Providing an attractive APY which incentivizes contributors to hold INDEX (increases allocation retention rate)</li>
<li>Over time distributing a greater % of ownership to contributors who have a higher propensity to hold vs sell (gives more INDEX to those with the highest allocation retention rate)</li>
</ol>
<h3>
<a name=""h-55-dynamic-staking-model-estimated-rewards-11"" class=""anchor"" href=""#h-55-dynamic-staking-model-estimated-rewards-11""></a>5.5 Dynamic Staking Model estimated rewards</h3>
<p>We propose the following reward breakdown through the Dynamic Staking Model to achieve a target y1 community allocation of 5% (i.e. starting in Jan 2022).</p>
<p><strong>The figures provided here are illustrative based on several assumptions (below) which will likely be subject to change</strong></p>
<p>Assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of contributors at each Owl Levels</li>
<li>Average token holding by Owl Level</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fig 1 - Revised DSM Monthly Ownership Allocation (table)</strong></p>
<p>The table below shows the monthly reward breakdown based on Owl Level and INDEX Holdings across 5 Owl Levels categories.</p>
<p>As you can see, a change from the previous model has been the inclusion of a fixed standard INDEX stipend regardless of holdings. This was done to provide greater clarity and transparency to new hires on the fixed INDEX reward they receive.</p>
<p>Furthermore, including the categories of “Neon” and “Gold+” allows us the flexibility to further incentivise high impact contributors and leaders at INDEX Coop. Those who go through our new “Priority Hiring Process” will receive an increase in their fixed allocation of INDEX to reward their long term commitment and focus on Index Coop.</p>
<p>We anticipate current Index Coop “Full Timers” being moved onto the higher fixed INDEX allocation and additionally gaining access to the DSMs flexible reward based on token holdings.</p>

<p>We also want to make clear some new hires might be offered a different fixed monthly allocation of INDEX to the ones displayed above. This is to ensure the model can still provide flexibility to recruit top talent.</p>

<p>This mechanism creates an attractive APY for all contributors across the spectrum. It encourages contributors to hold their tokens and ensures long term a community allocation will be distributed to those with the <strong>highest propensity to hold, versus those with the highest propensity to sell</strong>.</p>
<p>This will enable the Dynamic Staking Model to achieve a higher Allocation Retention Rates than any other ownership allocation mechanism currently seen in web3.</p>

</div></a></div>Finally, we received feedback that our previous model did not do enough to incentivize the highest impact contributors (i.e. Gold Owls).

<h3>
<a name=""h-56-conclusion-13"" class=""anchor"" href=""#h-56-conclusion-13""></a>5.6 Conclusion</h3>
<p>We hope the updates to the Dynamic Staking Model captured above, addresses several of the major feedback points for this model, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>The DSM is confusing and doesn’t provide stability for new hires</li>
<li>The DSM doesn’t incentivize long term contributors</li>
<li>The DSM doesn’t adequately reward the highest impact contributors and leaders</li>
</ul>
<p>We also wanted to address several other considered challenges below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Dynamic Staking Model creates a “hard cliff” after Y5 when it is discontinued</strong>
<ul>
<li>We are providing a fixed allocation via the DSM of “5%” only in year 1. The remaining 16% will be allocated flexibility over Y2+ based on market conditions and/or treasury health. Index Coop will retain the flexibility to adjust DSM rewards, parameters and yearly community allocation target throughout the program to guarantee flexibility and ensure the model is sustainable and driving the right outcomes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Can the Dynamic Staking Model be gamed once third party borrowing markets for INDEX are created</strong>
<ul>
<li>These types of borrowing markets for INDEX do not currently exist, so there is no immediate risk to the model. However, over time they are likely to emerge</li>
<li>Thus, we propose over the next 6 months the DSM transitions to a ""closed system”. This means that after 6 months only INDEX earned through the DSM, or which has previously been deposited in a custom-built Staking Module will count towards the total INDEX holdings.</li>
<li>This transition does not impact the integrity of the DSM as it will still serve its core purpose, incentivising ownership (INDEX) retention. However, it will negate the threat of medium-to-long term gaming via INDEX lending/borrowing markets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<a name=""h-6-airdrop-14"" class=""anchor"" href=""#h-6-airdrop-14""></a>6. Airdrop</h2>
<p><strong>6.1 Summary</strong></p>
<p>The Dynamic Staking Model provides an effective forward-looking way to align incentives of contributors with the broader community, attract and retain talented contributors, and build sustainable community ownership.</p>
<p>However, it does not address a historic failure to build ownership among contributors. Since genesis, <strong>less than 2% of ownership has been delivered to the community at large</strong>, with many vital contributors having negligible ownership in Index Coop despite their impact and importance to the Coop.</p>
<p>Below we can see a summary of the initial token distribution along with vesting periods, highlighting when ownership becomes liquid. As can be seen below a large proportion of the initial token supply was distributed to liquidity incentives and airdrops to early holders and LP positions.

<p>Retroactive airdrops to early contributors are not a form of wealth redistribution - it’s actually a late payment for wealth that was in fact created by contributors, especially as the airdrop more powerfully rewards contributors that are still active. This late payment helps quickly increase long-term, high-value contributors’ INDEX holdings, to use in the DSM, and lessen their attraction to external opportunities over the 6 month period before the first DSM rewards vest.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""h-62-calculating-the-airdrop-15"" class=""anchor"" href=""#h-62-calculating-the-airdrop-15""></a>6.2 Calculating the Airdrop</h3>
<p>The calculation for the airdrop is guided by:</p>
<ol>
<li>The 1.5% of total $INDEX mentioned above which the airdrop will distribute</li>
<li>A contributor’s value contributed to the Coop in the first year, as measured in USD value of $INDEX they cumulatively received from October 2020 to December 2021. We then add 75% USD on top for contributors who are still active (as defined by receiving rewards (or impression mining rewards) in two of Oct, Nov and Dec ‘21).</li>
<li>First year starts Oct ‘21 as very little rewards were earned in Oct ‘20</li>
<li>A contributor’s personal participation in the airdrop will equal:</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
<em>If you’d contributed A. $100k of value in the first year, the community had contributed, B. $1m of value and C. total payout via the airdrop is 1.5% out of 10,000,000 tokens the model would deliver you the following tokens:</em></p>
<p><em>(A. $100,000 / B. $1,000,000) X (C. 1.5% X 10,000,000) = 15,000 $INDEX</em></p>
<p>Once the rewards for December have been finalised, we will share an updated model which shows the final airdrop amount contributors would expect to receive. The general distribution logic before special situations is discussed and potentially catered for, below.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""h-63-airdrop-and-full-timers-16"" class=""anchor"" href=""#h-63-airdrop-and-full-timers-16""></a>6.3 Airdrop and “Full Timers”</h3>
<p>Given that: i) the airdrop is now 1.5% not 7%, ii) we have added an active/inactive lookup in the airdrop model, iii) we have increased the fixed INDEX allocation in the DSM and iv) we have increased the overall rewards from the DSM, we propose “Full Timers” (still active, logically) are eligible to receive the airdrop in full.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""h-64-vesting-17"" class=""anchor"" href=""#h-64-vesting-17""></a>6.4 Vesting</h3>
<p>An individual’s airdrop will be received monthly over six months with no requirement to maintain active status. Contributors active and inactive are eligible for their airdrop tokens over six months. Given the airdrop is substantially smaller now, with an active/inactive lookup in the model, we think this distribution logic is fair.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""h-65-airdrop-key-changes-18"" class=""anchor"" href=""#h-65-airdrop-key-changes-18""></a>6.5 Airdrop key changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reduction in the community airdrop from 7% to 1.5% of total allocation</li>
<li>Changed payout details to make the airdrop payout over a period of 6 months, after which point the rewards from the Dynamic Staking Model will come into effect</li>
<li>Lookup for active/inactive in the model, to reward contributors still here</li>
<li>Inclusion of impression mining into rewards</li>
<li>Full Time contributors will receive their airdrop in full, with no reductions or additional vesting terms.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name=""h-7-priority-hiring-19"" class=""anchor"" href=""#h-7-priority-hiring-19""></a>7. Priority Hiring</h2>
<p>The final aspect of the proposed Compensation and Community ownership work was an updated set of Priority Hiring Guidelines. This should be seen as a minor improvement, not a comprehensive overhaul of the Full Time Hiring Guidelines. More details of our “Priority Hiring” guidelines can be read <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/compensation-v2-fixed-salary-hiring-guidelines/3196"">here</a>.</p>
<p>In summary, the Priority Hiring Guidelines seeks to identify the highest leverage contributors and/or most strategically important roles at Index Coop and provide them with a competitive salary and compensation package to retain them for long via:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed yearly salaries</li>
<li>Fixed Owl Level, and so INDEX allocation per month</li>
<li>Priority hires also get access to the Dynamic Staking Model like all other contributors</li>
</ul>
<p>Simply put, some contributors need long term employment stability and a fixed yearly salary. In web3’s competitive labour market, failure for Index Coop to provide this stability would be a major oversight. Thus, the need for Priority Hiring Guidelines.</p>
<p>Based on feedback, we have moved away from the term “Full Time” and embraced the fact that contributors may participate in multiple DAOs - and that is ok. However, there is an expectation that everyone who goes through the “priority hiring” process will be primarily focused on Index Coop.</p>
<p>Those working across many other DAOs in a more flexible way will find the flexible compensation framework more suitable to their changing situation. It is important to highlight that those under the flexible hiring framework can still expect to receive significant rewards for value delivered.</p>
<p>With the creation of the Index Council on November 30th, the order of prioritising for contributors and positions to go through “Priority Hiring” will be determined by the Index Council.</p>

<a name=""h-8-treasury-20"" class=""anchor"" href=""#h-8-treasury-20""></a>8. Treasury</h2>
<p><strong>Treasury disclaimer</strong> <em>- Finance Nest to the best of its ability has provided an estimate of the potential future balances and with unknown costs is unable to provide a detailed picture of the next 12 -18 months. We are working with members of the DAO to create a more detailed budget and cashflow forecast that will be presented in due course.</em></p>
<p>We invited Finance Nest to review this proposal to provide feedback on its financial viability. Taking into account expected future costs and also the DAO’s current and future reserves balance</p>
<p>If this proposal were to pass, non-earmarked reserves would total 379,747 INDEX and $4,727,000 USDC. In addition to this, Index Coop would also have a ring-fenced warchest of 1,500,000 INDEX and further $5,000,000 in USDC to be maintained in the event we have to deploy a significant amount of capital in the future.</p>

</div><p>It is also important to highlight again, the “Y2+ Dynamic Staking Model community allocation of 16%” will be delivered flexibly, and allocation in a given year will be decided by the Index Council with input from Finance Nest factoring in market conditions, treasury health etc. This will provide Index Coop the flexibility to ensure its long term longevity…</p>

<a name=""h-9-kpi-bonus-21"" class=""anchor"" href=""#h-9-kpi-bonus-21""></a>9. KPI bonus</h2>
<p>Originally this proposal had suggested some percentage of the Community Ownership would be unlocked once a series of ambition KPI were reached. However, in the face of some budgetary uncertainty, and to reduce complexity, we have now removed this recommendation from the proposal.</p>
<p>We do not want to close the door entirely on KPI options, rather keep the concept but not commit with this group, and handoff work that’s been done to the Index Council to consider at a later date.</p>

<p>After this, we will go heavily into the implementation specifics with Engineering WG. We want to note that there are various ways in which the proposal above can be implemented with greater or lesser degrees of complexity.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
The following time-off/leave guidelines are intended to improve coordination and promote positive contributor wellbeing. We have no intention of imposing a rigid leave policy on the DAO. We acknowledge we are in a critical and early stage of growth and can’t accommodate excessive leave. As such, we are suggesting guidelines and a process to help avoid contributor burnout, while still promoting a culture of high impact work and hustle.</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong><br>
This first iteration of formal ‘Time-Off’ guidelines are broken down to address:</p>
<ol>
<li>Non compensated time-off (non Gold+ Owls)</li>
<li>Compensated time-off (Gold+ Owls)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Non compensated time-off (non Gold+ Owls)</strong></p>
<p>There is no limit to how many days of unpaid leave an Owl can take. All contributors should do their best to communicate effectively within their nest to plan, manage time and set realistic expectations ensuring time-off is well coordinated around existing commitments/expectations.</p>
<p>If a contributor is expecting significant interruption to their workflow which would impact their ability to deliver planned work, they are expected to discuss this within their nest with as much notice as possible.</p>
<p>If there are extenuating or special circumstances where a non-Gold+ Owl would like to request paid time off, they are encouraged to discuss this with their Nest Lead.</p>
<p><strong>Compensated time-off (Gold+ Owls)</strong></p>
<p>Gold+ Owls are contributors who have been through the formal hiring process and have committed significant time to the Coop. Most often, these contributors are full-time.</p>
<p><em>Time-off process:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Review the guidelines to determine leave eligibility below</li>
<li>Check the ‘<a href=""https://www.notion.so/index-coop/a20b7a81b80f4d87baef2415b5e3a4e1?v=e20d13aa27de424ab74520b40ecb05bc"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Time-Off Calendar <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""4 clicks"">4</span></a>’ for any existing conflicts with contributors who have already requested time-off. Where possible, try to avoid taking time off where multiple requests will likely impact the ability of your nest/pod to deliver important work. Use your best judgment</li>
<li>Communicate with your pod/nest/nest lead with as much notice as possible</li>
<li>Log your information in the time-off database here: <a href=""https://www.notion.so/index-coop/a20b7a81b80f4d87baef2415b5e3a4e1?v=017cd8b07bfb407c807773ab4efa74d1"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">https://www.notion.so/index-coop/a20b7a81b80f4d87baef2415b5e3a4e1?v=017cd8b07bfb407c807773ab4efa74d1 <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""3 clicks"">3</span></a>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Most of us have now experienced first-hand the struggle of balancing the needs of DAO contribution with personal health and external obligations. Burnout is real and it is already taking a significant toll on our contributor base and our ability to communicate and coordinate effectively together.</p>
<p>Taking time away from work is important, not only to handle personal matters and take care of illnesses but also for physical and emotional well-being. In addition to improving contributor well-being, we believe formalizing a leave process will significantly improve productivity, coordination and communication.</p>

</h3>
<p>The Index Coop is on a mission to make crypto investing simple, safe, and accessible for everyone.</p>
<p>To achieve this mission over the long term, the Coop must invest in 3 areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product <strong>growth</strong>
</li>
<li>Community <strong>autonomy</strong>
</li>
<li>Protocol <strong>sustainability</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Balancing these three priorities is not easy.</p>
<p>Yet, if we are successful, the outcome will be massive. The Coop will continue to be a model for other crypto communities to follow. We will have balanced 1) creating value for our stakeholders with 2) building a <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/notes-defi-citadels-by-ryan-watkins/1009"">DeFi Citadel <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""5 clicks"">5</span></a> while 3) shipping &amp; growing at startup speed.</p>
<p>Here are some rough ideas for what that end-state of the Coop might look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Model Crypto Citizen</strong>: We are known in crypto as being a model of a well-run DAO that produces impact &amp; outcomes. This will attract high-quality stakeholders and create a positive feedback loop.</li>
<li>
<strong>Startup-like</strong>: The Index Coop is a startup (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html"">Paul Graham</a> &amp; <a href=""https://steveblank.com/2010/01/25/whats-a-startup-first-principles/"">Steve Blank <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a> offer two widely-accepted definitions). Success will follow if we borrow values, thinking, and actions crucial for tech startup success.</li>
<li>
<strong>Global</strong>: We have active, engaged community members in crypto-epicenters around the world.</li>
<li>
<strong>Balanced governance</strong>: Influence is balanced between major stakeholders.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fluid power</strong>:  Self-forming, delivering, and dissolving teams are the primary way we tackle problems as a community.</li>
<li>
<strong>Self-perpetuating</strong>: Coop leaders of all kinds create new leaders to ensure the community continues to improve and grow.</li>
<li>
<strong>DeFi Leaders</strong>: We envision the Coop as the training ground for the next generation of crypto and DeFi leaders. We hope that this community will help spawn the protocol founders and crypto leaders of tomorrow. These community members will continue to deeply engage with Index Coop and spread the Coop gospel (recruiting, protocol politicking, other collaboration).</li>
</ul>
<p>These ideas are still early and need feedback/sharpening from all Coop stakeholders.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""objectives-kpis-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#objectives-kpis-3""></a>Objectives &amp; KPIs <img src=""https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/bar_chart.png?v=12"" title="":bar_chart:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":bar_chart:"" loading=""lazy"">
</h3>
<p>To make progress towards this vision in Q2-2021, here are 3 objectives to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Product growth</strong> - The Coop solidifies its lead as the <span class=""hashtag"">#1</span> DeFi index manager.</li>
<li>
<strong>Community autonomy</strong> - The Coop has evolved into an even more autonomous organization. A diverse and engaged community is an unforkable advantage for long-term success.</li>
<li>
<strong>Protocol sustainability</strong> - Protocol resources are managed in a trust-building &amp; resilient manner. Trust, security, careful risk management, and treasury management are crucial pillars.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are already on our way to each of these objectives as a community <img src=""https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/muscle.png?v=12"" title="":muscle:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":muscle:"" loading=""lazy"">  This is thanks to the massive, Coop culture-defining effort by everyone last quarter.</p>
<p>To offer some targets (KPIs) that will help us know whether we are on track towards those objectives, here are 4 product growth goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$500M</strong> AUM</li>
<li>
<strong>400,000+</strong> DPI supply units</li>
<li>
<strong>$9M</strong> FLI suite 7-day moving average volume for 2 consecutive weeks</li>
<li>
<strong>4</strong> new products launched with <strong>$200M+</strong> combined TVL. They are category leaders in terms of the most relevant measure (i.e. uTVL, volume, liquidity)</li>
</ul>
<p>These goals reflect a few core beliefs, including that we must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continually focus our efforts on growth to ensure long-term success</li>
<li>Double (and triple) down on winning products</li>
<li>Launch new products that have the potential to become category leaders</li>
</ul>
<p>Now is the time for focus, great execution, and learning together through it all.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Set published the <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-coop-open-letter/4147"">Open Letter <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""47 clicks"">47</span></a> with 1kx to encourage and incentivize Index Coop to achieve a number of goals and become more focused, commercial and, ultimately, successful. Two of these goals were: ‘incentivize top leaders and talent’ and ‘bring back building’. Over the last few weeks Index Coop and Set have been negotiating a deal to help Index Coop incentivize its key people and launch products more efficiently via new access to Set Protocol. This deal also aims to enable Index Coop to have full autonomy and free Set from day-to-day involvement with Index Coop.</p>
<p><strong>High-level terms</strong></p>
<p>Index Coop and Set are pleased to have agreed the following high-level terms. Fuller structure and operational details covered below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Set will hand over the Index Treasury to Index Coop</li>
<li>Set will transfer 950,000 INDEX to Index Coop, in the form of the Set Labs Y2 and Y3 vesting contracts and a top-up transfer of INDEX tokens</li>
<li>Set is happy for Index Coop to redeploy Set Protocol in good faith and launch new products on this new system
<ul>
<li>Set agrees to support existing products running on its version of Set Protocol</li>
<li>Index Coop will support new products on its newly deployed version</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Execution of terms &amp; detail</strong></p>
<p><em>1: Treasury hand over</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set will add these five addresses to the <a href=""https://etherscan.io/token/0x0954906da0bf32d5479e25f46056d22f08464cab?a=0x9467cfadc9de245010df95ec6a585a506a8ad5fc"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Treasury multisig <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""9 clicks"">9</span></a>, which represent the three Index Coop Cayman Foundation directors, three ICC members and one member of the finance function: 0xdF4C03660aD86C20aDEccA95a86f5044f38FcA56, 0x96EB65c02B0bc06E758bA916D3652b659ca2C671, 0xD19e5913C33E7d69a7f66c090760B3e611106b9A, 0x57D0C0f6458284884F0654CAa53811D013bB6f20, 0xB639DAd047432727309e2BBBaB74cE204E3a9623</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Index Coop will remove three Set addresses from the multisig, leaving the remaining five Index Coop addresses as signers. The multisig will be run as a three of five</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>2: INDEX transfer</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After claiming vested tokens, Set will change the beneficiary address on the <a href=""https://etherscan.io/token/0x0954906da0bf32d5479e25f46056d22f08464cab?a=0x4c11dfd35a4fe079b41d5d9729ed34c00d487712"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Set Labs Year 2 vesting contract <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""5 clicks"">5</span></a> to the <a href=""https://etherscan.io/address/0x9467cfADC9DE245010dF95Ec6a585A506A8ad5FC"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Treasury multisig address <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""2 clicks"">2</span></a></p>
<ul>
<li>There are approximately 708,000 tokens vested at 10.08.2022, assuming day count in the calculation - leaving 132,000 INDEX unvested</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set will change the beneficiary address on the <a href=""https://etherscan.io/token/0x0954906da0bf32d5479e25f46056d22f08464cab?a=0x0d627ca04a97219f182dab0dc2a23fb4a5b02a9d"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Set Labs Year 3 vesting contract <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""3 clicks"">3</span></a> to the <a href=""https://etherscan.io/address/0x9467cfADC9DE245010dF95Ec6a585A506A8ad5FC"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Treasury multisig <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""2 clicks"">2</span></a> address</p>
<ul>
<li>This Y3 vesting contract has its full 560,000 INDEX unvested</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set will transfer 258,000 INDEX tokens to the Treasury multisig. The multisig will be controlled by the five addresses mentioned in 1.a at this point.</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculation to generate the token number above: 950,000 - (560,000+(840,000-708,000)) = 258,000</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Index Coop and Set will work together to execute 1 and 2 above, using internal tracking and risk management docs and checks, before follow up comments and links to Etherscan are shared in the comments below.</p>
<p>If due to a number of days passing Index Coop and Set need to recalculate the INDEX value for 2.c, that can be done and posted as a comment update.</p>
<p>3: <em>Redeploy protocol</em><br>
Index Coop will confirm its ability to deploy its own version of Set Protocol to Set Labs before moving to deploy its own version over the next couple of weeks. Set agrees to answer set up and support questions from Index Coop, with the aim that Index Coop is fully independent from a technology perspective as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
We, Index Coop and Set, aim to execute these steps shortly - and hope this deal will enable both sides to independently move forwards towards bright, successful futures. Onwards!</p>",Index,DevOnDeFi,

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Index 2.0 is the community’s effort to tackle the community’s toughest organizational and structural questions and begin building the foundations for further growth</li>
<li>These challenges span the themes of: Financial / Administrative Capabilities, Third Parties / Methodologists, Protocol Ownership / Compensation, Leadership &amp; Strategy, and Product &amp; Engineering Autonomy</li>
<li>The proposed plan is to host a series of educational workshops led by high context subject matter experts to build common understanding. This will lead to solutions that can be implemented via IIP and the community voting process</li>
<li>The Index 2.0 team’s role is to steward the process impartially and to support subject matter experts in providing context and next steps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
Faced with complex internal and external-facing challenges, the community held the “Autonomy Work Session” on July 14th [<a href=""https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Iigv8PSdW-XtyPQMdolNIy4DxD8LA4tM612C9CH0Gvs/edit#slide=id.gb6e33d0f6a_0_77"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">slides here <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""12 clicks"">12</span></a>], which led to the formation of the “Autonomy Kick-Off Group” on July 27th [<a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/formation-of-the-autonomy-kick-off-group/1988"">forum post here <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""7 clicks"">7</span></a>].</p>
<p>The Autonomy Group was formed to develop a plan to work through the Index Coop’s biggest autonomy and/or organizational issues with an initial deliverable to be shared by August 25th.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Update</strong><br>
For the past month, this group met 1-2x a week on Tuesdays / Thursdays to better define the community’s issues and work towards generating a comprehensive path towards the general goal of autonomy.</p>
<p>Through the collaboration and input of all members, we aggregated a list of <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z6XzKX_ef4Smc_YVkVxK_cnFUSlKXXK6bEFiMKwiIaY/edit#gid=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">major issues and potential solutions <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""8 clicks"">8</span></a> which were categorised into the following themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Financial / Administrative Capabilities</strong>: Transitioning the Treasury wallet authority to the community, transfers funds to the Operations and Investment Accounts for the community to manage. Define signers composition of various multi-sig accounts and develop community competency for managing the various accounts. Defining decision-making, feedback, and conflict-resolution processes as well as administrative processes such as payroll, billing, etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Third Parties / Methodologists</strong>: Defining clear responsibilities between methodologists and Index Coop partners, establishing robust communication channels between the Index Coop, establishing a clear way to design and honor fair agreements, protect IP and trademark from methodologists, and define guidelines for fair play.</li>
<li>
<strong>Protocol Ownership and Compensation</strong>: Defining hard power impacting the community (e.g. movement of capital and voting), designing the protocol ownership and rewards system to properly compensate and align key contributors, and revisit how decisions are made (e.g. voting).</li>
<li>
<strong>Leadership and Strategy</strong>: Defining soft power impacting the community (providing direction, gathering support), defining the parties responsible for generating a vision, strategy, and roadmap. Defining the structures to coordinate resources for tackling strategic initiatives and keeping counterparties accountable. Ensuring foundations are in place for executing and tracking results.</li>
<li>
<strong>Product and Engineering Autonomy</strong>: Development of mature Index Coop product and engineering capabilities, increases in visibility of direction of Set’s priorities re: product and engineering development processes, and ability to uphold the Index Coop brand promise of safety, security, and functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Index 2.0</strong><br>
We recognize that autonomy is intricately linked with complex organizational and structural issues. To overcome these challenges, we recognize that we need to reflect on what type of organization we want to be and types of ways that we need to grow or “level up” to handle these growing pains.</p>
<p>The entire process of tackling the community’s toughest organizational and structural questions and building the foundations of a prosperous organization is what we call Index 2.0.</p>
<p><strong>Goal and Principles</strong><br>
The ultimate goal is to co-create a vision of autonomy together where all parties are aligned, there is empathy and common understanding of the subject matters, and we are able to create a top-down plan while also making bottom-up / tactical progress.</p>
<p>In determining next steps, we believe it is important to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Support Community Led Solutions</strong>: Instead of the Autonomy Group providing a Top-Down solution for others to adopt, we aim to undertake an approach that enables the community to co-create a solution</li>
<li>
<strong>Foster Open Communication and Build Common Understanding</strong>: Increase common understanding so we can have meaningful and productive conversations</li>
<li>
<strong>Start with Foundational Elements and Build Up to Complex Topics</strong>: As some topics require common understanding on other topics, we recommend establishing fundamental building blocks that can be progressively built upon to handle more complex topics.</li>
<li>
<strong>Identify Stewards for the Process and Clear Owners for Next Steps</strong>: To ensure productive conversation and accountability for next steps, stewards of the Autonomy Process will strive to create a productive environment and ensure there are owners that own action items / next steps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Plan</strong><br>
Utilizing the above principles, we propose a plan where we host a series of public educational workshops led by the respective domain experts to build common understanding.</p>
<p>The outputs of these workshops will help inform our understanding of the problem (which feeds into our <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z6XzKX_ef4Smc_YVkVxK_cnFUSlKXXK6bEFiMKwiIaY/edit#gid=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">master list on pain points <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""8 clicks"">8</span></a>) and will allow the community to craft well-considered plans which can be executed upon. The intention is that these plans for issue resolution are presented as IIPs for further discussion ahead of formal snapshot voting</p>
<p>The Index 2.0 team (previously Autonomy Kick-Off Group) will be responsible for stewarding this co-creation process and will support domain experts stepping up to research, design and drive workshops/discussion across key themes and topics. Please note that the stewards uphold the process, but do not influence the outcomes anymore than any other individual.</p>
<p><strong>The Workshops</strong><br>
We plan on hosting a series of workshops over the course of September and October that cover the various themes and are led by their respective functional experts. Each workshop will have pre-reading (which will be published on the governance forum) and publicly published minutes summarising the workshop discussion.</p>
<p>Please note that workshops, even focused on a particular topic, may be run over multiple sessions. Our intention is not to rush the conversation as these are complex topics and will take time to work through.</p>

<h3>
<a name=""introduction-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#introduction-1""></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Index Coop has evolved dramatically since Set founded and launched it in October 2020.</p>
<p>Throughout that evolution, the nature of the Set &lt;&gt; Index Coop (IC) relationship has also changed. We’ve recently entered a new, exciting phase for both organizations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this post is to share Set’s goals and how the Set &lt;&gt; IC relationship is evolving.</p>
<p>This post will be successful if it helps Index Coop core contributors, community, and other core stakeholders better understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set’s evolving relationship with the Index Coop</li>
<li>Set’s intentions</li>
<li>Set’s beliefs of what matters most for Index Coop success</li>
</ul>
<p>We recognize that we exist in a rapidly evolving market and environment, so this post reflects how we view things today. We will update as needed.</p>
<p>This post does not change the nature of collaboration for Set &amp; Index Coop teams already working closely together. Instead, it communicates the big picture.</p>
<p>We are excited for the future of Set, the Index Coop, and our organizations working together towards <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/discussion-affirming-our-code-of-conduct-and-guiding-principles/2404"">shared goals <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a> and mutual success.</p>

<a name=""set-protocol-and-the-index-coop-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#set-protocol-and-the-index-coop-2""></a>Set Protocol and the Index Coop</h3>
<h4>
<a name=""set-protocol-description-goals-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#set-protocol-description-goals-3""></a>Set Protocol: Description &amp; Goals</h4>
<p>Let’s root ourselves in the basics.</p>
<p>Set Protocol is an asset management platform. Set’s purpose is to increase financial prosperity by making powerful financial tools accessible to anyone in the world. We’re building a fully-featured and reliable platform for investors to access packaged strategies, and for creators to launch / grow / maintain strategies and build asset management businesses.</p>
<p>Today, we are focused on improving the Set platform and shipping successful products in order to rapidly increase protocol adoption and TVL.</p>
<p>This goal requires that Set</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Improves the platform for asset managers and developers</strong> - We expect to continue to foster an ecosystem of asset managers (including Index Coop) and developers using Set technology. To do this will require that we improve the platform in response to their needs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Supports successful products</strong> - We expect to be focused on structured products in categories where we believe we can be <span class=""hashtag"">#1</span> or <span class=""hashtag"">#2</span> in the market.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Index Coop remains our closest partner</strong> for achieving these goals. We know that by improving the platform and supporting successful products both the Index Coop and Set will win (<img src=""https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/owl.png?v=12"" title="":owl:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":owl:"" loading=""lazy"" width=""20"" height=""20"" style=""aspect-ratio: 20 / 20;"">,<img src=""https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/balance_scale.png?v=12"" title="":balance_scale:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":balance_scale:"" loading=""lazy"" width=""20"" height=""20"" style=""aspect-ratio: 20 / 20;"">).</p>
<p>Achieving those two goals also requires focus. We intend to fully distinguish Set Protocol and Index Coop from one another so that both organizations can double down on their strengths.</p>
<h4>
<a name=""index-coop-origins-and-set-relationship-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#index-coop-origins-and-set-relationship-4""></a>Index Coop Origins and Set relationship</h4>
<p>These goals are made possible due to how far the Index Coop has come since Set launched it with a simple <a href=""https://medium.com/indexcoop/introducing-the-index-cooperative-a4eaaf0bcfe2"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">post <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""2 clicks"">2</span></a> and <a href=""https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GRhB9EQXEtdSXB-m4B459lr9BZ95LCTeG-WdDZIvH5Q/edit#slide=id.g38420732af_0_142"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">community call</a> in October 2020.</p>
<p>Set launched the Index Coop in order to support the DeFi Pulse Index. A decentralized community was needed to govern, rebalance, and grow the product and creating a community from scratch was the answer.</p>
<p>Of course, the Coop has evolved significantly since launch. Over 11 products with ~$150MM TVL are in the market, $10MM was raised from investors, the brand is strong and the community is thoughtful, hardworking, and passionate. It’s clear that the Coop strives to be a great and lasting organization that marks the best of DeFi.</p>
<p>So too has the Set &lt;&gt; Index Coop relationship evolved. While not linear or obvious, we’ve tried to approach the relationship in a manner of <a href=""https://www.aspengroup.com/blog/five-steps-of-leadership-development"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">leadership development  <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a>and hand over more responsibility and autonomy to non-Set core contributors over time. Roughly speaking, the relationship has changed over 3 phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phase 1 : October 2020 - February 2021</li>
<li>Phase 2 : March 2021 - June 2021</li>
<li>Phase 3: July 2021 - December 2022</li>
<li>Phase 4: January 2022 - ??</li>
</ul>
<p>We are now in the midst of an exciting 4th phase in which our organizations will become fully distinguished from one another such that the Coop can fully stand on its own two feet without Set’s operational involvement.</p>
<p>This milestone is a testament to the hard work and dedication of everyone who has contributed along the journey so far.</p>
<p>At a high level, this 4th phase requires that Set transfers the remaining operations (primarily technical in nature) to Index Coop Directly Responsible Individuals (DRis) in an intelligent and safe manner. We will continue to do this based on a clear vision, intentional planning, and effective collaboration such that both organizations are set up for success. In the end, Set will remain a core Index Coop stakeholder and will continue to work in collaboration with our Coop colleagues in the highest-leverage ways possible.</p>
<p>We see a future in which the collective Index Coop ecosystem (Index Coop, Set, other partners) is able to create, grow, and maintain <strong>dozens and then hundreds</strong> of desirable products - leading to <strong>significant TVL growth</strong> for all ecosystem organizations.</p>

<p>To reach that vision, both Set and the Index Coop need to focus on their strengths.</p>
<p>Set will continue to support the Index Coop in the highest-leverage ways we can.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Technology Provider</strong> - Set is a technology provider and is focused on building fully-featured and reliable infrastructure that enables Index Coop and other asset managers to create, grow, and maintain delegated management products.</li>
<li>
<strong>Leadership Provider</strong> - Achieving our shared goals will require working alongside Coop leadership structures. Contributing executive level leadership / strategy, and generally supporting the creation of an environment that enables the Coop to become a lasting DeFi institution.</li>
<li>
<strong>Product Idea Provider</strong> - Guiding methodologists interested in building on Set Protocol (inbound to Set) and in need of the Coop’s core value propositions to and through the Index Coop to launch their product(s). Contributing methodologies and giving 100% of fees to IC (i.e. <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/proposal-launch-a-basis-trading-product-suite/3954"">Proposal: Launch a Basis Trading Product Suite <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>We see the Index Coop success as dependent on the number of <strong>successful products</strong> that it <strong>creates, grows,</strong> and <strong>maintains</strong> autonomously and sustainably.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Create - Source &amp; select the best product ideas to create:</strong> Properly generating these ideas requires immense creativity, market insight, and experience. Ideas can be generated internally or via external partners. Strong product judgment is required to determine what will do well in the market.</li>
<li>
<strong>Grow - Effectively bring products to market and grow them:</strong> This requires a deep understanding / insights of what it takes to launch successful products and to lean into the opportunities that generate these products.</li>
<li>
<strong>Maintain - Autonomous and sustainable product maintenance:</strong> This requires dedicated team members who are empowered with the proper tooling and technology to ensure that products are maintained indefinitely.</li>
</ul>

<p>To <strong>create</strong>, <strong>grow</strong>, and <strong>maintain</strong> successful products requires organizational capability and the will to focus on those 3 pillars of success. This means optimizing resource allocation to core create/grow/maintain functions.</p>
<p>If create, grow, maintain are the Index Coop’s focus, success will follow.</p>
<p>Set &amp; Index Coop teams are already working together towards these roles, and Set will continue to lend significant resources and support to ensure that we reach the end-state in a position that leaves both organizations poised for further growth.</p>
<p>This ongoing, phase 4 collaboration has rested on two key pillars that we fully expect to continue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear, consistent, open communication - We have established clear, known communication channels between our organizations.</li>
<li>Clear collaboration - Creating clear collaboration agreements, especially as related to product create/grow/maintain.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a name=""conclusion-8"" class=""anchor"" href=""#conclusion-8""></a>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Set is excited for the future of Set, the Index Coop, and our organizations working together towards shared goals and mutual success.</p>
<p>Key Takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li>Set is focused on building the platform and products needed in order to rapidly increase protocol adoption and TVL.</li>
<li>In relation to the Index Coop, Set will be focused on where we can highest-leverage: Technology, Leadership, Product Ideas</li>
<li>In order for the Coop to succeed, we believe it must focus on 3 core pillars of product: create, grow, and maintain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s to our future success!

<p><strong>Background:</strong> Wednesday’s Org Work session (14th July - <a href=""https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/1/d/1Iigv8PSdW-XtyPQMdolNIy4DxD8LA4tM612C9CH0Gvs/edit#slide=id.ge4c8733a1e_0_0"">see slides <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""20 clicks"">20</span></a>) was dedicated to discussing autonomy issues that had been brought up by many Index Cooperative contributors.</p>
<p>Greg Docter and Felix Fang kicked-off the conversation by presenting slides that communicated how Set Labs understood the issues as brought forward by the community, after which Thomas Hepner moderated a Question &amp; Answer session.</p>
<p>The big takeaway from the call was the need for a better understanding of the priority and requirement for greater Index Coop autonomy - and the need for better communication between key stakeholder groups. This could be enabled by standing up a cross-functional team made up of key stakeholders.</p>
<p>This group would support Index Coop mature towards a position of greater autonomy and preempt and address pain points in this transition process. The group would also identify and drive forward organizational/structural initiatives to help Index Coop and key partners to collaborate, coordinate and communicate more seamlessly going forward.</p>
<p>Initially, a major part of this effort could centre around an Autonomy Roadmap to be jointly created by all stakeholders (i.e. Index Coop contributors, Set Labs, DeFi Pulse, and other stakeholders).</p>
<p><strong>Key Action:</strong> Formation of Autonomy Kick-Off Group by 27th of July.</p>
<p><strong>Deliverable:</strong> Initial Autonomy Roadmap by 25th of August.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Recurring monthly forum post and “All-Hands” meeting led by the to-be-formed Autonomy Kick-Off Group for public accountability.</p>
<p><strong>Group Structure:</strong> We propose that this group be made up of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>3 Community Contributor Representatives</strong> (this includes contributors of all stripes, such as: contributors, community methodologists, prospective community methodologists, working group leads, full-time contributors)</li>
<li><strong>1 DeFi Pulse Representative</strong></li>
<li><strong>1 Set Labs Representative</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We believe that 5 people is the optimal number of individuals for this group, at least initially, to make rapid progress with representatives from each of the Index Coop’s core stakeholders (i.e. Set Labs, Pulse Inc, Index Coop contributors, outside investors).</p>
<p>The initial roadmap they produce will ultimately be subject to full community scrutiny in the forums.</p>
<p><strong>Nomination Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Set Labs and DeFi Pulse</strong> will nominate their own representatives for the group and comment on the forum post who their nominee(s) are.</li>
<li>
<strong>Community Contributors:</strong> Reply to this post to nominate yourself or other individual(s) for consideration.</li>
<li><strong>Nomination Period: The nomination period will last from 12:00 PM (7:00 PM UTC) 16th of July to 12:00 PM (7:00 PM UTC) 21st of July.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Selection Process:</strong> A survey will be created for community voting on the representatives from each stakeholder group.</p>
<ul>

<p>Title: Finance Nest - Autonomy to Act Amendment <span class=""hashtag"">#1</span><br>
Status: Propose<br>
Author: <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/Finance"">@Finance</a>, <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/elliottwatts"">@ElliottWatts</a> and <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/matthew_graham"">@Matthew_Graham</a><br>

<h1>
<a name=""simple-summary-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#simple-summary-1""></a>Simple Summary</h1>
<p>The Finance Nest has a strong track record and is one of the most advanced Treasury teams in Defi. This proposal presents the community the opportunity to expand Finance Nest remit and transition Finance Nest into a back office function. Building on <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/proposed-iip-123-finance-nest-autonomy-act/3646/6"">IIP-123 <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""2 clicks"">2</span></a> this proposal includes the ability to attain and manage a line of credit that will be used to support creating, growing and maintaining our products/business, and the ability for Finance Nest to manage any amendments to the signers on the Operations and Investment Account multisigs. This operational flexibility will help the community to realise our ambitious growth objectives.</p>
<p>The intent is to reduce operational burden and place more responsibility and trust in Finance Nest. Finance Nest will be transitioning more towards becoming a back office that can service the DAO autonomously with monthly forum status updates, replicating the success of the FLI pod.</p>
<h1>
<a name=""abstract-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#abstract-2""></a>Abstract</h1>
<p>Finance Nest seeks the approval of the community to extend the current guidelines/boundaries enabling the ability to act with more autonomy. This proposal expands the Finance Nest remit to amend the signers on the Operations and Investment Accounts and the added ability to utilise debt for growing the business. Do note, some of the icETH liquidity is already funded using over collateralized debt via Rari Fuse Pool 8 to support the product launch which is different to a line of credit facility.</p>
<p>Debt is a widely used and powerful tool that can be utilised to accelerate growth and provide operational flexibility for how capital is deployed. Finance Nest seeks to expand upon the Autonomy to Act remit to include the ability to attain lines of credit to support the growing Index Coop’s business. Any debt will be used to support growing the business both directly and indirectly through things like Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) and through deploying capital into delta neutral strategies in order to acquire strategic assets which help us attain our growth ambitions.</p>
<h1>
<a name=""motivation-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#motivation-3""></a>Motivation</h1>
<p>In recent times, Index Coop has greatly increased the rate at which products are being launched. We expect this to continue and anticipate some of these products will require more capital to launch than today’s products in circulation. Protocol Owned Liquidity has absorbed all of our revenue as we continue to reinvest into growing the business.</p>
<p>Our growth ambitions are great and rather than try to juggle several different initiatives, Finance Nest recommends obtaining a line of credit to provide additional operational flexibility to the community. Key drivers for seeking the ability to attain a line of credit that provides extensive operational flexibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rate at which products are being launched is increasing</li>
<li>Product pipeline features several capital intensive products</li>
<li>Various delta neutral strategies within defi enable Index Coop to accumulate strategic assets</li>
</ul>
<p>As we increase the rate at which we create products, we need to scale our ability to launch and maintain those products. Currently, our revenue is not growing fast enough and we could use our stables but the opportunity cost of the stables exceeds the cost of debt. To support Index Coop’s growth ambitions we need to enable the business to pursue growth without unnecessary capital constraint.</p>
<p>With minimal financial engineering, Finance Nest will deploy several strategies that act to generate cash flow exceeding the cost of any debt. Essentially, Index Coop will have no price volatility risk, will be able to borrow debt at a lower interest rate than the yield we earn, thus making a profit. This is known as a delta neutral free-carry trade. We are essentially creating a self repaying loan which frees up capital to be deployed supporting various growth initiatives across the business. Ie: Some debt is used to generate an income to maintain and pay back the credit line, whilst other debt is directly invested into growth initiatives like POL.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, Finance Nest is proposing the responsibility of updating/maintaining who is an Operations and Investment Account multisig signer. Finance Nest has submitted many IIPs in effort to optimise the signers on the accounts to keep up with people coming and going from the DAO along with improving the responsiveness of the signers on the wallet. Rather than continue to present IIPs, Finance Nest intends to perform these tasks in the background and provide monthly updates on each account detailing any amendments to the signers or signer requirements. Please note the signer requirements are still to run through the IIP process, it is just the ability to change who is a signer will be passed to Finance Nest.</p>
<h1>
<a name=""specification-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#specification-4""></a>Specification</h1>
<p>This proposal builds upon the permission granted by the Index Council for Finance Nest to engage with other DAOs offering lines on credit within DeFi. There are a number of DAO bringing various debt offerings to DeFi and Index Coop has the ability to be a launch partner whilst also attaining much needed operational financial flexibility.</p>
<p>This proposal grants Finance Nest the ability to enter into agreements with other DAO for attaining a line of credit. All reporting will be via the monthly reports which are shared on the governance forum. This will be how Finance Nest communicates what are the loan terms, what is the debt is being used for, what is the return on investment and how this is contributing to Index Coop realising its ambitious growth targets.</p>
<p>Various DAO that are coming to market offer widely varying services with very different requirements. Index Coop has been for some time now engaging with several DAOs and is now approaching the late stages of discussion. Finance Nest did hope to have the line of credit in place by now, but hope to have it in place soon. This line of credit will bring the operational flexibility we need to grow at the rate we desire.</p>
<p>In scope parameters</p>
<ol>
<li>​​Type of collateral supporting the loan</li>
<li>Limit of exposure ie: Debt ceiling</li>
<li>Selecting counterparty / DAO(s)</li>

<a name=""simple-summary-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#simple-summary-1""></a>Simple Summary</h1>
<p>The proposal presents an opportunity for INDEX holders to support the creation of Governance House, a new type of DeFi primitive that provides Metagovernance as a Service across the ecosystem. Governance House intends to unlock an entirely new phase of community and voter participation by leveraging existing skills within the Index Coop community and enhancing the reach of metagovernance by including members of other DAOs to support the implementation of welcomed improvement proposals across DeFi.</p>
<p>Governance House is to become a DeFi focal point for providing Metagovernance as a Service (MaaS). The MaaS offering ranges from improving voter participation, all the way through to writing, coordinating and submitting improvement proposals on various protocols of varying degrees of difficulty.</p>
<h1>
<a name=""abstract-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#abstract-2""></a>Abstract</h1>
<p>Index Coop’s metagovernance is a strength and with the creation of Governance House subDAO the Metagovernance value becomes clear. The vision for Governance House is to become a collaboration hub, an industry leader that supports the growth of the ecosystem. Governance House will expand the network and reach of Index Coop by welcoming trusted members from other communities into Governance House and attracting delegate votes from other communities.</p>
<p>Today, there are many DeFi communities that struggle with voter apathy, optics around decentralization and having to choose between working on large system upgrades or more operational day to day changes. Governance House intends to help communities to become more decentralized by supporting smaller operational upgrades needed to maintain existing DApps. This helps free up the core teams to focus on leveling up from V1 to V2 to V3 etc…</p>
<p>Governance House intends to optimize for voting, coordinating, writing and submitting governance proposals to implement welcome change within DeFi. Governance House will become a trusted partner with defi that will be known for acting in the best long term interest of the community/ecosystem.</p>

<a name=""discussion-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#discussion-3""></a>Discussion</h1>
<h2>
<a name=""introduction-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#introduction-4""></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Governance House provides MaaS across DeFi through collaboration with some of the largest names in the ecosystem. Governance House will have sufficient INDEX voting right to meet quorum, whilst also having additional delegated voting rights to other protocols which enhances the metagovernance reach beyond just Index Coop’s influence.</p>
<p>The metagovernance influence is enhanced by the delegation of outside votes to Governance House with the goal of coordinating, preparing the payload, submitting payload and voting on welcomed improvement proposals across DeFi. The vision is to work closely with the participating communities to attain sufficient governance support to streamline on-chain governance processes.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, only improvements welcomed by the receiving community will be supported by Governance House. There is no means of bribing or manipulating Governance House into supporting something not welcomed by the receiving community. Each respective community will be involved in the review process of the payload prior to it being submitted on-chain. This is in line with how Index Coop currently prepares AIPs within the Aave community.</p>
<p>In time, the intent is to use Smart Contracts wherever possible. However, during the initial phase Governance House seeks to define what is the minimum viable product and find a strong sense product market fit. The metagovernance influence will be coordinated by a relatively small and well connected team that is Governance House before moving more on-chain in later iterations.</p>
<p>Governance House will work with Index Coop to maximize the use of its metagovernance voting rights and in the near term, would like to expand beyond on-chain votes to become more active in community snapshot votes used to gauge sentiment for upcoming proposals.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""how-it-works-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#how-it-works-5""></a>How it works</h2>
<p>Token holders can delegate their vote to a wallet address that is then used to vote and deploy various improvement proposals across DeFi.</p>

<p>Members of Governance House shall always collectively exceed the INDEX quorum threshold which grants passage to using the underlying metagovernance influence. Governance House proposes replacing the MGC by performing all the on-chain coordination and voting. Index Coop is expected to continue to operate Snapshot as it currently does with Engineering having automated metagovernance votes.</p>
<p>With respect to internal Index Coop votes, Governance House as a collective group shall abstain from Index Coop’s IIP voting that is not specific to Governance House and each individual participant is free to express their own view. Do note, this means each respective INDEX holder’s votes are still implemented via the delegate address and the decision to vote and how to vote falls solely on the owner of the INDEX tokens. Non INDEX holding voting rights are pooled and INDEX voting rights will remain delegated to separate wallets. For larger INDEX holders who delegate INDEX voting rights to Governance House, a wallet is set up whereby the delegator can participate in IIPs and Governance House can participate in Metagovernance votes.</p>

<p>All metagovernance votes are still intended to run through the Index Coop snapshot as per normal process and all INDEX holders can vote. Should a metagovernance vote reach quorum, Governance House will execute the vote accordingly (same process as with MGC today). Index Coop’s metagovernance votes will be delegated to an EOA as determined by Governance House. This enables Governance House to utilize the proposal power to submit improvement changes on various protocols and participate in snapshot proposals of other communities.</p>
<p>The creation of Governance House enables any good actor across DeFi to propose an improvement to a protocol. Governance House can provide everything from a full turn key solution to simply providing proposal power to implement an improvement proposal. This type of service does not exist in DeFi today.</p>

<p>Governance House intends to provide the following as a part of the MaaS offering.</p>
<ol>
<li>Active voter participation.</li>
<li>Provider a focal point for entities seeking to propose a change.</li>
<li>Liaison between core community members and entities seeking to propose a change.</li>
<li>Prepare governance forum posts.</li>
<li>Conduct Snapshot votes.</li>
<li>Submit on-chain proposals to implement improvement proposals.</li>
</ol>
<p>In return, Governance House is to receive payment for performing MaaS. This payment is to be distributed to Contributors during the initial phase and then also the Delegates during a later phase. The Payment is variable and shall reflect the complexity and extent of the work required to fulfill the request. During initial phases, payment is expected to cover the operating costs and reinvestment costs in growing Governance House. Governance House is actively seeking funding from various grants across DeFi, with its first application pending.</p>
<p>The longer term intention is to distribute rewards to delegates. However, the initial iteration will focus on rewarding contributors and saving funds to support the development of Smart Contracts that enable Governance House to transition towards becoming a more on-chain operation. The below graphic communicates the rewards flow within the model. In time, Governance House intends to reward delegates and the current thinking involves accepting INDEX as payment and distributing INDEX to delegates (later phase) and contributors (initial phase) alike.</p>

<p>For external Participants providing non INDEX, the token is to be swapped for INDEX.

<p>The above graphics show the later phases when Governance House finds product market fit for MaaS. There are already promising signs emerging showing strong support for the concept expressed above.</p>
<p>The astute reader may realize that this mechanism is using INDEX as the life blood of the system, which in turn creates a steady flow of buy side demand for INDEX. This is a positive flywheel for INDEX holders and helps distribute INDEX to those who contribute to Governance House.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""what-is-governance-house-6"" class=""anchor"" href=""#what-is-governance-house-6""></a>What is Governance House</h2>
<p>Governance House is a subDAO of Index Coop consisting of like minded delegates and contributors who are all working to improve DeFi, through coordinating and implementing welcomed change on existing protocols. Governance House solves the complexities of coordinating and implementing change across DAOs. External protocol Core Teams, Investors, Contributors alike can all approach Governance House seeking to implement change on their preferred protocol or seek voting support to prevent any bad actor from taking advantage of a protocol. As metagovernance delegation influence grows, Governance House becomes an enabler to implement welcomed change and provide a level of protection from bad actors across an increasing number of protocols.</p>
<p>Governance House members are very well connected across DeFi, have deep understanding of the protocol, are active on the protocol’s forum and trusted by the community. This enables Governance House to build trust and obtain additional voting influence over time. On-chain voting records will demonstrate reliability and will serve as a testament to the character of Governance House. Individuals within Governance House are expected to perform the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specialize in governance matters.</li>
<li>Share knowledge with each other collaboratively for the benefit of DeFi.</li>
<li>Active governance participants.</li>
<li>Onboard delegates.</li>
<li>Support the structuring of deals for Governance House.</li>
<li>Write / Coordinate submission of forum posts, snapshot and improvement proposals.</li>
<li>Provide a link between Index Coop and the broader DeFi ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name=""achievements-to-date-7"" class=""anchor"" href=""#achievements-to-date-7""></a>Achievements to Date</h2>
<p>Below is a list of proposals which can be implemented by the Governance House with the Aave community:</p>
<ul>
<li>AVAX risk parameter update, [4].</li>
<li>Add DPI to mainnet Arc market, [5].</li>
<li>Liquidity mining on mainnet Arc market, [6].</li>
<li>Update risk parameters mainent Arc market, [7].</li>
<li>Add DAI to mainnet Arc market, [8].</li>
</ul>
<p>To accompany some of the above work a grant application has been submitted to Aave Grants DAO, [9]. We have active members of the Aave community contributing to Governance House in coordinating the above scopes. AIPs for the first few proposals to be implemented are already being worked on.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Governance House has commits for 41.2K of INDEX from Galaxy Digital, 20.6K from WhiteStar Capital, 17K from 3SE Holdings and expects a further 60.2K from another large investor. We also expect several smaller holders to participate which takes Governance House near and over quorum. There are several other entities that have expressed interest and we hope they will join Governance House in time.</p>
<p>One of the key things here is for Governance House to always meet Index Coop’s quorum requirements.</p>

<p>For the initial phase, Governance House will support protocols where Index Coop is already active or pursuing metagovernance integrations (AAVE, Compound, Maker, etc…) and communities that have delegated voting rights to Governance House. For example, Tribe DAO has delegated AAVE and COMP voting rights to Index Coop and 2M TRIBE to members of Governance House, [11,12,13,14 ]. We expect others to follow in time and there are currently proposals being discussed that expand the reach of Governance House.</p>
<p>At the time of writing there are four developers, potentially a four soon, who are actively engaged in supporting Governance House initiatives. The developers are Austin (Llama), Noah Citron (Index Coop), Defi Jesus and Rajath (Llama). There are other developers that can be called upon as/if needed. Most of these developers have existing working relationships with Aave developers which is a great benefit.</p>
<p>Several meetings have been held with other DAOs and members from other communities are already contributing to Governance House. There has been an expression of interest from funds that hold INDEX partaking in Governance House activities. We have submitted our first ARC on the Aave governance forum, [1].</p>
<p>As Governance House becomes established more proposals like the one on Aave’s forum will be submitted. We intend to replicate this model across other DeFi communities whereby someone from that Community joins Governance House and brings with them a deep network and rich pipeline of opportunities to collaborate.</p>
<p>Ideally, members of Governance House are already active in other DeFi communities with established networks. To this end, there are members of Governance House who are actively involved in Aave, Tribe and Maker communities.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""future-phase-10"" class=""anchor"" href=""#future-phase-10""></a>Future Phase</h2>
<p>Governance House will seek to become a go-to place for metagovernance support within DeFi. To do that, there are a few goals Governance House needs to accomplish:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build a strong presence in the governance activities of the underlying protocols and earn/build trust.</li>
<li>Becoming a financially viable MaaS provider.</li>
<li>Build and maintain a secure meta-governance infrastructure.</li>
<li>Pro-ecosystem and have no bias between competitors.</li>
</ol>
<p>After proving the concept, Governance House will progress towards using Smart Contract wherever possible to facilitate the following via a MaaS User Interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smart Contract that facilitates the following:
<ul>
<li>Depositing funds</li>
<li>Whitelist for who can accept offers for providing MaaS</li>
<li>Uploading addresses for payment</li>
<li>Approval for distribution of funds</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MaaS Marketplace User Interface
<ul>
<li>Annualized APR for delegates</li>
<li>Metagovernance track record</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Upside</p>
<ul>
<li>Pathway to proposal power at a fourth major protocol, (Aave, Compound, Uniswap, ??).</li>
<li>Pathway to meeting voting threshold at a major protocol.</li>
<li>Deep integration with several leading DAOs across DeFi.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name=""organizational-structure-governance-house-subdao-11"" class=""anchor"" href=""#organizational-structure-governance-house-subdao-11""></a>Organizational Structure - Governance House subDAO</h2>
<p>After meeting with several INDEX investors, it was viewed that growing the metagovernance value proposition was best implemented outside of the Nest model. As a result, Governance House is a new subDAO which provides a degree of independence.</p>
<p>To enable access to Index Coop’s metagovernance, Governance House intends to have access to more INDEX voting rights than quorum. In many ways, Governance House is a collaboration of INDEX holders and their delegated representatives which collectively have sufficient votes to meet INDEX’s quorum requirements.</p>
<p>Governance House is a service provider subDAO that replaces the functionality of the MGC within the Metagovernance Pod and in time may adopt some of the other functionality of Metagovernance Pod. Governance House will communicate directly with the Index Council / Leadership Team of the day and will reside outside of the existing nest structure thus creating a degree of independence.</p>
<p>The Index Coop ambassador program has a very strong overlap with Governance House. The ambassador program is at its core and outreach program that helps build networks and identify opportunities to work together. This type of program will pivot to include the goal of trying to solve the voter apathy problem across defi. Governance House can boost voter turnout by being an active voter in Index Coop’s metagovernance votes and also directly in other communities votes. We intend to combine the benefits of the ambassador program with Governance House.</p>
<p>There are several examples of other communities that have created something similar but more tailored to their own community, [2,3,10].</p>
<h2>
<a name=""remuneration-12"" class=""anchor"" href=""#remuneration-12""></a>Remuneration</h2>
<p>All contributors receive a flexible reward based on output and impact. However, those that are Core Hires from Index Coop, and likely other DAOs, will be primarily funded through their existing remuneration agreements. Core Hires from Index Coop will receive a percentage of the flexible rewards they would have received if there were not a Core Hire. For Developers it is 25% and for everyone else 15%. This exists to prevent double dipping on rewards whilst providing motivation to grow Governance House’s operations whilst fulfilling their Core Hire responsibilities much like the logic applied to Core Hire within Product Pod [15].</p>
<p>For example if a grant is submitted with a cost input of $1,000 for Project Management and this is performed by an Index Coop Core Hire, that Core Hire receives 15% of the $1,000, $150. The remaining funds are to be retained by Governance House and reinvested into growing Governance House. Payments are made to contributors in line with the milestones linked to the terms laid out by grant application. Ie: 30% upon award, 30% milestone and 40% upon delivery.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""funding-request-13"" class=""anchor"" href=""#funding-request-13""></a>Funding Request</h2>
<p>During the initial phase, Governance House will be reaching out to various DAOs via existing grant programs to explore various funding options. An application has already been submitted to Aave Grants DAO and others are being discussed.</p>
<p>As Governance House will absorb the role of the MGC and requests Governance Nest to reallocate the three fifths of MGC’s budget during Season 1 to support growing Governance House. This is a total of $22.5K over Season 1 and is to be used for growing Governance House. The remaining two fifths of the MGC budget, $15K, is to be retained by Governance Nest. Payment distribution will be from Governance House Central utilizing Parcel in line with the normal process.</p>
<p>Governance House Central: 0x82cD339Fa7d6f22242B31d5f7ea37c1B721dB9C3</p>
<p>After Season 1 has concluded, any additional funding will be attained via a grant submission through Index Coop’s Growth Grants Program. It is highly probable that grant proposals will be submitted to other communities for providing MaaS.</p>

Created: 10 January 2022</p>
<h1>
<a name=""simple-summary-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#simple-summary-1""></a>Simple Summary</h1>
<p>The Finance Nest consists of finance and risk experts with experience in TradFi asset management, Big4 financial service accounting and DAO treasury management. We are a group of people that have a strong track record which has demonstrated the required skill and qualities to be able to make key decisions on treasury management and finances at the Index Coop.</p>
<p>After topping the IIP count last year, we are asking the community for more autonomy to act in the community’s best interests, allowing for more streamlined execution which is essential to scaling and growing the DAO operations. We have identified challenges within the current construct we wish to overcome and we believe, as much as everyone loves a good IIP, the community would prefer a few less from Finance Nest.</p>
<h1>
<a name=""abstract-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#abstract-2""></a>Abstract</h1>
<p>Finance Nest seeks the approval of the community to extend the current guidelines/boundaries enabling the ability to act with more autonomy. As the DAO moves closer towards creating nests with clearer roles and responsibilities, as outlined <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-2-0-leadership-governance-and-decision-making-pods-nest-and-wise-owls/3214"">here</a>, Finance Nest requests delegation of decision making power to those with the most context on the subject matter. Finance nest has built trust, has an on-chain and governance forum track record of demonstrating the ability to execute with the community’s interest front of mind. Finance Nest is leading the nest movement and provides several periodic reports providing insight into ongoing DAO financial operations.</p>
<p>However, recently we have had three distinct issues whereby the IIP process has caused hesitation or prevented swift intervention to rectify the situation. These emerging situations create a risk for our community and Finance Nest wants to help by being empowered to act swiftly.</p>
<p>This proposal delegates the ability to Finance Nest to perform a number of day to day type operations in a more autonomous manner as well as providing some much needed crisis management functional support. With more autonomy, streamlined decision making and ability to act in crisis situations, the Finance Nest can serve the community better. The Finance Nest will continue to provide periodic updates on the governance forum, host the Money Talks discussion each week in Discord which will be structured in such a way as to give an update to the community along with fielding any questions that may arise as a result.</p>
<h1>
<a name=""motivation-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#motivation-3""></a>Motivation</h1>
<p>In recent times, there have been three clear incidents whereby the ability to act in the interest of the community was dampened by the existing construct.</p>
<ul>
<li>Product launch seed liquidity (x2)</li>
<li>Product drifting from NAV (x1)</li>
</ul>
<p>In each of the three instances mentioned above, hesitation and technicalities relating to the governance process caused significant delay and unwanted attention. Discussions focused around if the community’s funds should be used to bridge the funding gap or used to arbitrage a product back to NAV before causing significant issues for various DeFi integrations. Index Coop has provided liquidity for two products to ensure smooth launches and with respect to arbitraging a product back to NAV, this was executed by individuals with their own capital.</p>
<p>In time the Liquidity Pod will have an approved budget, which is great. However, the lesson learned here is that the Finance Nest needs the ability to act with more autonomy without the risk of undermining the governance process.</p>
<p>The Finance Nest has demonstrated ability through the following IIPs to act in the communities best interest:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-70-create-a-stablecoin-reserve-within-the-operations-account/2210"">IIP-70: Create a Stablecoin Reserve Within the Operations Account</a></li>

</ul>
<p>As the community scales and grows, we need to implement an operating standard that ensures community funds are managed and deployed in a secure and efficient manner. This enables all members the ability to deploy or request that capital be deployed from the Operations Account into any protocol on the whitelist knowing sufficient due diligence has been performed. All deployments of community funds in size should be IIP approved and/or fall within guidelines published on the governance forum.</p>
<p>Examples of guidelines published to date:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/stablecoin-asset-management-guidelines/2099"">Stablecoin Asset Management Guideline</a>s</li>
<li><a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/twg-investment-account-philosophy/1564"">TWG - Investment Account Philosophy <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a></li>
<li><a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/investment-account-strategy-details/2792"">Investment Account - Strategy Details <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, there is no approval list or standard approach to how/where community funds can be deployed. Creating a whitelist with guidelines around how to be added to the whitelist solves for this. As we can see from the list of IIPs below, they are all in different formats and the information is scattered across the governance forum. The community will benefit from having a github directory displaying the whitelist of approved protocols.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-79-authorize-the-operations-account-for-aave-balancer-compound-and-pooltogether-strategies/2402"">IIP-79: Authorize the Operations Account for Aave, Balancer, Compound, and Pool Together Strategies</a></li>

</ul>
<p>This whitelist provides a much needed layer of security ensuring Finance Nest and others alike only acts within the bounds defined by the community. This reduces the possibility of the community losing funds or transactions directing funds beyond the approved list being processed. If the protocol is not on the whitelist, then this gives signers the ability to question a transaction in an easy and effective manner.</p>
<h1>
<a name=""specification-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#specification-4""></a>Specification</h1>
<h2>
<a name=""operation-investment-accounts-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#operation-investment-accounts-5""></a>Operation &amp; Investment Accounts</h2>
<p>This proposal enables Finance Nest the ability to create Operations and Investment Accounts with the same list of signers across all networks. This is needed to support the deployment of FLI products on various networks and enable Finance Nest to act quickly. The risk becomes that if <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-xy-delegate-fli-launch-decisions-to-pwg-dfp-on-a-per-chain-basis/3599/3"">FLI products can launch without IIPs</a>, then Finance Nest needs the ability to act at the same speed and with similar delegation of authority. Capital can be moved between various accounts at the discretion of the Finance Nest and will only be deployed into protocols on the community’s protocol approved whitelist.</p>
<p>Do note any changes to the signers will still run through the IIP process. We do not want a situation to occur where people can be added for the sole purpose of facilitating faster transactions. Rather we encourage the correct multisig structure and signer requirements to protect community funds.</p>
<p>Finance Nest will be creating guidelines outlining best practices for creating various multisig Gnosis Safes across the DAO. This guideline will be the standard that that community discusses and then implements. Some of the things to be included are shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of signers required depending on level of capital within the account</li>
<li>Signers per Nest - specifies number of signers from a specific nest</li>
<li>Capital holding levels</li>
<li>Interaction with the whitelist</li>
<li>How to appropriately document transactions</li>
</ul>
<p>The initial guidelines for discussion will be published on the forum in the coming weeks…</p>
<h2>
<a name=""crisis-management-6"" class=""anchor"" href=""#crisis-management-6""></a>Crisis Management</h2>
<p>This proposal enables Finance Nest the ability to use community funds within the Operations Account to support Index Coop products when crises emerge without the need to go through the IIP process. The Index Coop Council (ICC) will be kept informed in real time and events will be either reported via a standalone forum post or the next Operations Account publication. For significant events whereby we need to deviate from white lists or large amounts of capital will have to be deployed, an open discussion will be held with the ICC and Finance Nest advice given on the best course of action. In this type of scenario we will follow best practices like those displayed by Aave with respect to <a href=""https://app.aave.com/#/governance/44-QmNVWrrm3ieyRRVD4f77zdxrvSUj1W4HDCojLKNcxmVQhr"">AIP-44</a> and on the <a href=""https://governance.aave.com/t/aip-44-discussion/5965"">governance forum</a> as events unfolded.</p>
<p>A recent example of this was when a product drifted 10% from Net Asset Value (NAV), the Operations Account could have been used to arbitrage the product back to NAV. Instead individuals performed arbitrage trades with their own capital. Please note, there is now an IC controlled/affiliated bot now arbitraging the pool back to NAV. This is an example of an unanticipated need to act and by not having access to the Operations Account capital it caused delays, indecision and in the end alternative solutions had to be found. We seek to avoid being in this predicament if something like this ever happens again.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""approve-request-funding-from-the-treasury-account-7"" class=""anchor"" href=""#approve-request-funding-from-the-treasury-account-7""></a>Approve &amp; Request Funding from the Treasury Account</h2>
<p>The Funding Council’s responsibility to request quarterly funding has been passed to <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-2-0-our-future-of-finance/2969"">Finance Nest through the INDEX 2.0 process.</a> With the ICC being formed in recent months this group has been given the delegated authority on a number of matters, one being the ability to approve quarterly Nest budget funding requests, examples shown below. The Finance Nest, upon receiving an ICC approved budget, seeks the ability to request funds from the community Treasury without the need to go through the IIP process. Finance Nest seeks the autonomy to request quarterly funding without IIP.</p>
<p>We can see below the IIP’s proposed for quarterly funding since genesis, all which have passed with no resistance.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-4-create-a-treasury-committee/190"">IIP-4 Create a Treasury Committe</a>e</li>
<li><a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-10-treasury-committee-grant-2/373"">IIP-10 Treasury Committee Grant #2</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-21-treasury-committee-grant-3/1067"">IIP-21 Treasury Committee Grant #3</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-59-funding-council-grant-4/2033"">IIP-59: Funding Council Grant #4</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-94-funding-council-grant-5/2944"">IIP-94: Funding Council Grant #5</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-85-temporary-funding-council-decision-making/2668"">IIP-85 Temporary Funding Council Decision Making</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This will allow the Index Coop to remain well funded without significant delay due to the governance process. This also means we can discretionary request smallers transfers more frequently rather than all at once. The key is to have enough INDEX &amp; USDC to support short term operational needs and to operate within the ICC defined budget published quarterly on the governance forum. Finance Nest will still need to request USDC from the Treasury to the Investment Account ( non Operational needs ) in line with the current IIP process.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""manage-revenueasset-mix-8"" class=""anchor"" href=""#manage-revenueasset-mix-8""></a>Manage Revenue/Asset Mix</h2>
<p>As the DAO grows we expect to see an increasing need to more actively manage our capital. This is especially the case for FLI product revenue streams, numerous other product revenue streams and our stablecoin reserves, as we are likely to reward more contributors with stables going forward.</p>
<p>As the Operations Account receives inflows of various assets and accommodates outflows in various assets, Finance Nest requests to formally recognise the ability to manage the composition of the Operations Account to suit operational needs. This includes the ability to swap assets to suit the cost base, reduce leverage exposure to match a desired risk profile, etc… A prior IIP detailing approval to sell FLI periodically to ETH is shown below.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-87-transfer-fli-products-in-treasury-to-operations-account/2444"">IIP-87: Transfer FLI Products in Treasury to Operations Account</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We do note that all INDEX sales need to go through the IIP process. Something as sensitive as selling INDEX large amounts of INDEX ( ≥50,000 USD ) needs to and will continue to be approved via the IIP process. Currently, only day to day operations whereby INDEX is sold on a decentralized exchange to then make payments occurs. As the Operations Account offers Nest all kinds of tokens, we do not see a need for any Nest/Pod to be swapping large amounts of INDEX for any other token.</p>
<p>Community capital will always be managed in line with the respective published guidelines.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""whitelist-protocol-fund-deployments-9"" class=""anchor"" href=""#whitelist-protocol-fund-deployments-9""></a>Whitelist - Protocol Fund Deployments</h2>
<p>The whitelist is only applicable when depositing sums of capital ≥50,000 USD into contracts belonging to the same protocol. Essentially, if anyone wants to deposit $50K or more into a singular protocol ( one or more smart contracts ) then the protocol must be on the whitelist. $50K was selected as a nominal number. For values less than $50K, there are no guide rails and discretion falls to the respective budget owner.</p>
<p>Creating an IIP to add a protocol to the whitelist is open to everyone and the forum can discuss the associated risks. Once added to the whitelist, everyone in the community knows the protocol has been deemed safe and can trust the process for how the protocol was added to the list.</p>
<p>Finance Nest will maintain the whitelist via the github directory and provide the templates supporting the IIPs amending the whitelist. Risk analysis can be performed via the governance forum, for all to discuss, with guidance found on github detailing how to think about smart contract risks. This will be in a similar fashion to how Aave assesses new asset listings.</p>
<p>To bring the whitelist in line with our current and near term operational needs the following additions are to be added Uniswap, Sushiswap, TokenSets, Visor, Gelato and Tesr Finance.</p>

Gelato has been added to provide alternative functionality for future product launches.</p>
<p>Tesr Finance is a yield farming protocol on Polygon and expected to launch on other L2. Tesr vaults are designed to generate yield using the best yearn strategies adapted for Polygon. Vaults are capital pools that automatically generate yield based on opportunities present in the market. Vaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and rebalancing process. The vault management fee is 2% and it represents a flat rate taken from vault deposits over a year. The performance fee is 20% and is deducted from the yield earned every time a vault harvests a strategy.</p>

<a name=""introduction-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#introduction-1""></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>This proposal aims to create an Internal Methodologist Committee (IMC) within Index Coop. IMC will be responsible for monitoring the indices of products that do not have third-party methodologists. Additionally, the committee will ensure that third-party methodologists adhere to Index Coop regulations about changes and rebalances of index methodology. The IMC will initially comprise three members with experience in managing and maintaining on-chain indices, and more members can be added or removed through the Index Improvement Proposal (IIP) process.</p>
<h1>
<a name=""motivation-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#motivation-2""></a>Motivation</h1>
<p>Index Coop currently supports several products that do not rely on a third-party methodologist to determine the methodology. We expect to launch more products like this in the future. It is necessary to adapt and improve product methodologies over time to execute the best possible version of the strategy, manage risk, and improve liquidity conditions for the underlying assets. Oversight is required to ensure that existing methodologies are consistently executed and that any changes or updates are communicated to the broader community.</p>
<p>To ensure best practices in maintaining and improving methodologies, it is necessary to delegate this responsibility to specific Index Coop contributors with expertise in managing on-chain indices. This proposal seeks to create an IMC to assume responsibility for this role.</p>
<h1>
<a name=""specification-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#specification-3""></a>Specification</h1>
<h3>
<a name=""overview-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#overview-4""></a>Overview</h3>
<p>The IMC will be responsible for updating and maintaining the methodologies for the following products:</p>
<ul>
<li>icETH</li>
<li>dsETH</li>
<li>MVI</li>
</ul>
<p>Any future Index Coop products that launch without a third-party methodologist will also come under the purview of the IMC. In the event that Index Coop agrees to join in partnership with a third-party who will assume the Methodologist role for any or all of these products, these responsibilities can be revoked by IIP.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""structure-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#structure-5""></a>Structure</h3>
<p>The IMC will consist of three members with expertise in on-chain indices, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class=""mention"" href=""/u/afromac"">@afromac</a></li>
<li><a class=""mention"" href=""/u/mrmadila"">@mrmadila</a></li>
<li><a class=""mention"" href=""/u/sidhemraj"">@sidhemraj</a></li>
</ul>
<p>IMC members will serve until they are removed by an IIP or voluntarily step down. Additional members can be added or removed by IIP. IMC members will not be additionally compensated as they will be core contributors to the Index Coop DAO.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""responsibilities-6"" class=""anchor"" href=""#responsibilities-6""></a>Responsibilities</h3>
<p>The IMC will be responsible for ensuring that product methodologies are fair and objective and that they represent the best possible version of the strategy that Index Coop can execute with the current resources and information available. This will be achieved by defining clear and quantifiable rules and criteria and removing any ambiguous language that might exist in the methodologies today.</p>
<p><strong>Updating Methodologies</strong></p>
<p>Over time, product methodologies should be updated when new technology and information becomes available. Any changes to a product methodology should be clearly communicated to the wider community, along with the rationale for the changes. A product methodology should only be updated infrequently to ensure consistency for token holders.</p>
<p>The IMC will regularly review existing methodologies to determine if any changes or updates are necessary. This formal review will occur bi-annually, and informal discussions will continue throughout the year to keep the methodologies up to date. If a change is proposed, one of the IMC members must publish the proposed change on the forums. The committee, consisting of three members, will use optimistic governance, which means that any communication from a committee member will be considered to have been unanimously agreed upon unless objected to on the forum by the two other members. In the event of a dispute, changes can be resolved via an IIP</p>
<p><strong>Executing Rebalances</strong></p>
<p>The IMC will also ensure the highest standards in data collection, methodology execution, and communication around product rebalancing and reweighting. Data should be collected from multiple trusted data providers to ensure accuracy. The raw data should also be made available in the Pre-Rebalance Report to protect against data manipulation, errors, and corruption.</p>
<p>All intended rebalance trades should be communicated in advance to token holders, and all trades to execute the rebalance should prioritize capital preservation as the primary goal.</p>
<p>Specific milestones and documentation to be published during the rebalance period includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Collection: To occur 10 days before a rebalance</li>
<li>Pre-Rebalance Report: To be posted 1 week before a rebalance</li>
<li>Rebalance Date: To begin on the first working day of the month in line with the specific schedule of the product methodology</li>
<li>Post-Rebalance Report Date: To be posted within 3 working days of the completion of the rebalance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Criteria for Membership</strong></p>
<p>All candidates for inclusion in the IMC now or in the future should have previous experience in designing and operating on-chain financial products. It is highly recommended that they are recruited from the product team directly, as is the case for this initially proposed cohort.</p>
<p>Specific competencies include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Risk management</li>
<li>On-chain liquidity evaluation</li>
<li>Financial data analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-compliant members can be asked to stand down by the Operations Pod, and be replaced by IIP.</p>

<h2>
<a name=""simple-summary-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#simple-summary-1""></a>Simple Summary</h2>
<p>Quorum for metagovernance voting will be reduced linearly from 5% down to 1% as support increases (on a per-proposal basis) to inspire greater decentralization and allow for greater participation in Index Coop metagovernance by the community.  At present, the 5% quorum is a holistic blocker to participation given it is rarely achieved.  This change allows for overwhelming support of a proposal to be executed directly; both reducing the workload on the MGC when a majority opinion is clear and creating a more decentralized decision framework for metagovernance voting.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""abstract-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#abstract-2""></a>Abstract</h2>
<p>This proposal changes the quorum calculation for metagoveranance voting from a flat 5% (with quorum failures going to the 5-member <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/context-and-discussion-metagovernance-voting/4178"">MGC <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a> to decide) to a linearly reduced quorum number as the percentage of votes cast FOR or AGAINST deviates from 50%.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""motivation-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#motivation-3""></a>Motivation</h2>
<p>‌<br>
At present quorum is rarely achieved during metagoveranance voting.  At issue, non-whale interest is not sufficient to pass metagovernance votes despite regular INDEX voting.  The fallback mechanism of the MGC will remain in place for contentious votes with low participation; however, the lack of ability to influence metagovernance by a majority of INDEX holders with no clear path to influence is suppressing the price of INDEX by creating a non-competitive metagovernance environment, currently advantageous only to large token holders and MGC members.<br>
‌</p>
<h2>
<a name=""specification-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#specification-4""></a>Specification</h2>
<h3>
<a name=""rationale-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#rationale-5""></a>Rationale</h3>
<p>Quorum is a hurdle-rate that is in place to ensure that there is sufficient contextual input into a vote (using voting token <em>amount</em> as a proxy for interest+context).  Quorum being too low means not enough context from the voting body has been aggregated, too high means that even well-considered voting by many won’t effect the desired outcome without MGC assistance.</p>
<p>A dynamic quorum essentially calls for greater participation depending on the binary diversity of opinions on that proposal.   With the benefit of a fallback mechanism (the MGC) we can maintain the necessary forcing function (IC can’t re-run another protocol’s proposal due to insufficient quorum) so that a considered decision is registered in every case.</p>
<p><em>For example:</em> At full support, quorum drops to 1%; meaning fewer voters can influence the vote.  Quorum increases up to a maximum of 5%, should diversity in the cast-votes develop.  In this way, contentious votes require greater participation and therefore context to pass without the MGC stepping in.</p>
<p>The drawback here is that achieving quorum on a typical proposal has finality (beyond a static quorum, the indeterminant result is considered executable prior to the end of the voting period).  Dynamic quorum means that achievement of quorum cannot be determined until the end of the vote.  The MGC would need to be prepared to render a decision should the calculated quorum not be achieved once IC voting has ended.</p>

<p>Index Coop has enjoyed a valuable relationship with Wintermute over the last year plus - the genesis of the relationship beginning <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-83-wintermute-market-making-proposal/2575"">here <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""9 clicks"">9</span></a>. Wintermute has been our primary market maker since and this relationship has helped Index Coop list its governance token and products at centralized exchanges and also helped enable liquidity for our governance token and some products. Wintermute’s venture arm also holds an $INDEX position - participating in our Treasury Diversification round in ‘21.</p>
<p>However, now we’re in a new market cycle, past our agreement term end dates with Wintermute, with larger institutional partners looking to work with Index Coop (with greater market making thresholds to meet), it is in the interests of token holders to take a fresh look at our market making.</p>
<p>Thus, we invite crypto market makers to <a href=""mailto:institutions@indexcoop.com"">connect with us</a> to join partnership talks. We aim to learn:</p>
<ol>
<li>Partnership ideas generally and a range of commercial terms</li>
<li>Which potential market making partners are best placed to help us secure larger scale institutional partnerships</li>
</ol>
<p>The high level goals of market making at Index Coop are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable provision of sufficient liquidity for $INDEX and relevant products</li>
<li>Enable meeting of diligence requirements of large institutional partners who require a number of associated, reputable market makers</li>
</ol>
<p>More detail can be discussed in talks. We look forward to hearing from market makers via the email link above.</p>

<a name=""summary-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#summary-1""></a>Summary</h1>
<p>This proposal modifies the organizational structure of the Index Cooperative to increase robustness, operational efficiency, and empower the token holders with hard power, namely the ability to directly replace Safe signers.</p>
<p>Index Coop will adopt <a href=""https://www.metropolis.space/"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Metropolis <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""12 clicks"">12</span></a> (formerly known as Orca), a lightweight permissions wrapper around a Safe multi-sig that turns each Safe into a “<a href=""https://docs.metropolis.space/docs/pod-basics/pod-basics"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">Pod <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""7 clicks"">7</span></a>.” This creates an on-chain organization structure where power is delegated from token-holders to elected Pod Members.</p>
<p>The implementation proposed is intended to be version one, and this structure should continue to evolve over time.</p>
<p>There will be three high-level Pods that are responsible for the three main functions of Index Coop:</p>
<p><strong>Engineering:</strong> To deploy and maintain Index Coop smart contracts and products</p>
<p><strong>Operations:</strong> To serve the DAO’s off-chain needs such as product design, marketing, partnerships, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Treasury:</strong> To manage the Index Coop treasury, pay expenses, collect revenue, and deploy capital to investments</p>

<p>The Engineering, Operations, and Treasury Pod each have three representatives chosen by INDEX holders. Because Index doesn’t have a governor contract and due to the current limitations of Snapshot, a “Delegate Safe” will enact token holder decisions. In time, the Delegate Safe will be removed and INDEX holders can change Pod representatives directly.</p>
<p>Pods can create sub-Pods as shown in the diagram above. This proposal creates the structure as shown in the diagram with three high-level Pods and a number of function-specific sub-Pods.</p>
<p>As a result of these changes and <a href=""https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-165-contributor-ownership-plan/4423"">IIP-164 <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""8 clicks"">8</span></a>, the Index Coop Council (ICC) will cease to exist. The implementation of this structure should occur on or before December 31, 2022.</p>
<h1>
<a name=""motivation-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#motivation-2""></a>Motivation</h1>
<p>This proposal establishes a persistent system not reliant on a council to make difficult decisions, however, it will maintain the efficiency of decision-making and continue to provide a face to the organization that can interface with on and off-chain entities.</p>
<p>The system is built upon token holders’ sovereignty and their willing, explicit delegation of this power to various component parts, whether they be one or more levels removed.</p>
<p>The DAO must minimize human involvement in its operations to maximize security, robustness, and credible decentralization. Moving to this new organizational structure reduces the reliance on individuals; when human involvement is necessary, those individuals will be appointed and changed by token holders.</p>
<h1>
<a name=""specification-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#specification-3""></a>Specification</h1>
<h2>
<a name=""overview-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#overview-4""></a>Overview</h2>
<p>On-chain entities’ organizational structures are constantly evolving and Index Coop is adopting best practices from around the ecosystem. This proposal has received much iteration and feedback from advisors and community members to accomplish the following objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Reduce reliance on individuals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add on-chain governance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raise the primacy of token-holders</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, the proposed organizational structure was designed with the aim of keeping Index Coop DAO as nimble as possible. As a result, it broadly increases the decentralization regarding large and important decisions and outsources day-to-day, low-level, operational decisions to appointed Pod members.</p>
<h2>
<a name=""structure-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#structure-5""></a>Structure</h2>
<p>Currently, several multi-signature Safes are owned by the DAO, some of which are inactive. To simplify the structure, only active Safes (i.e., those with assets or permissions) are included in the new organizational structure.</p>
<p>The INDEX token-holders (“token-holders”) will elect representatives (i.e., signers) to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delegate Safe (5)</li>
<li>Operations Pod (3)</li>
<li>Engineering Pod (3</li>
<li>Treasury Pod (3)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each Pod has the discretion to create or modify sub-pods without direct token-holder approval.</p>
<p>Token-holders are also responsible for electing the Director(s) of the Cayman Foundation.</p>
<p>This proposal includes the initial representatives to each Pod and makes changes to the Directors of the Cayman Foundation. At any time, an IIP can be called to make changes to Pod representatives, Directors, or members of the Delegate Safe.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""directors-of-the-cayman-foundation-6"" class=""anchor"" href=""#directors-of-the-cayman-foundation-6""></a>Directors of the Cayman Foundation</h3>
<p>This proposal reduces the number of Directors from three to one with the sole Director as Index Coop’s fiduciary service provider.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""delegate-safe-7"" class=""anchor"" href=""#delegate-safe-7""></a>Delegate Safe</h3>
<p>The delegate safe is a temporary measure required due to technical feasibility. In the future, token-holders can change Pod representatives directly via a token vote. Because Index does not have a governor contract and due to limitations in Snapshot, the Delegate Safe will enact decisions made by token holders on-chain.</p>
<p>The delegate safe will begin with a 3-of-5 Safe with the original signers as follows:</p>

<a name=""operations-pod-8"" class=""anchor"" href=""#operations-pod-8""></a>Operations Pod</h3>
<p>The Operations Pod is a 3-of-5 Safe with 3 individual representatives, supported by the Engineering Pod and Treasury Pod as the additional two signers. The individual members will assist with day-to-day decisions and interface with partners and token-holders.</p>
<p>Currently, there would be no plans for the Operations Pod to handle any funds and most of the activity falling under its purview would be off-chain.</p>
<p>The Operations Pod is the manager of the Contributor Pod. The Operations Pod will be responsible for managing personnel, roles, and remits, and all proposed hiring and offboarding decisions are subject to 3-of-5 approval. This action will take place on-chain by removing the contributor from the Contributors Pod. The initial individual representatives to the Operations Pod are Dev, Anthony B, and Jordan T.</p>
<h4>
<a name=""contributors-pod-operationscontributors-9"" class=""anchor"" href=""#contributors-pod-operationscontributors-9""></a>Contributors Pod (operations.contributors)</h4>
<p>The Contributors Pod is a sub-Pod of the Operations Pod that enables all paid contributors of the DAO to exist on-chain via Metropolis’s Pod Member NFT system. This NFT acts as a “key card”, so to speak.</p>
<p>There are no immediate plans to use this feature set of Metropolis, but the Contributors Pod is useful for conducting on-chain votes by internal contributors on Snapshot (using the <a href=""https://snapshot.org/#/strategy/orca-pod"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">orca-pod strategy <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a>). It can also be used for token-gating access to things such as the internal contributor Discord Server. In addition to token-gating access, the Contributors Pod provides an additional layer of on-chain governance, which creates an auditable structure with a higher degree of decentralization.</p>
<p>The Contributors Pod will have a 1-of-n threshold because it will hold no funds and have no permission. All active paid contributors will be members of this Pod and issued NFTs.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""engineering-pod-10"" class=""anchor"" href=""#engineering-pod-10""></a>Engineering Pod</h3>
<p>The Engineering Pod is a 3-of-5 Safe with 3 individual representatives, supported by the Operations Pod and Treasury Pod as the additional two signers. The individual representatives will assist with deploying and maintaining smart contracts on behalf of the DAO. The permissions or keys to all Index Coop smart contracts are set to the Engineering sub-Pod, engineering.ops (eth:<a href=""https://etherscan.io/address/0x6904110f17feD2162a11B5FA66B188d801443Ea4"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">0x6904110f17feD2162a11B5FA66B188d801443Ea4 <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a>). The initial individual representatives to the Engineering Pod are Defensible LLC, Flattest White, and Sid Hemraj.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""treasury-pod-11"" class=""anchor"" href=""#treasury-pod-11""></a>Treasury Pod</h3>
<p>The “Treasury Account” (eth:<a href=""https://etherscan.io/address/0x9467cfadc9de245010df95ec6a585a506a8ad5fc"" rel=""noopener nofollow ugc"">0x9467cfadc9de245010df95ec6a585a506a8ad5fc <span class=""badge badge-notification clicks"" title=""1 click"">1</span></a>) will become the “Treasury Pod.” The Treasury Pod is a 3-of-5 Safe with 3 individual representatives, supported by the Operations Pod and Engineering Pod as the additional two signers. The individual representatives will assist with managing the assets of the DAO, paying expenses, processing payroll, and maintaining the runway. The initial individual representatives to the Treasury Pod are afromac, Mr Madila, and C-Squared LLC.</p>
<p>The Treasury Pod also has a number of Safes under its management that are used to segregate assets including:</p>

<h1>
<a name=""introduction-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#introduction-1""></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>This proposal aims to create an Internal Methodologist Committee (IMC) within Index Coop. IMC will be responsible for monitoring the indices of products that do not have third-party methodologists. Additionally, the committee will ensure that third-party methodologists adhere to Index Coop regulations about changes and rebalances of index methodology. The IMC will initially comprise three members with experience in managing and maintaining on-chain indices, and more members can be added or removed through the Index Improvement Proposal (IIP) process.</p>
<h1>
<a name=""motivation-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#motivation-2""></a>Motivation</h1>
<p>Index Coop currently supports several products that do not rely on a third-party methodologist to determine the methodology. We expect to launch more products like this in the future. It is necessary to adapt and improve product methodologies over time to execute the best possible version of the strategy, manage risk, and improve liquidity conditions for the underlying assets. Oversight is required to ensure that existing methodologies are consistently executed and that any changes or updates are communicated to the broader community.</p>
<p>To ensure best practices in maintaining and improving methodologies, it is necessary to delegate this responsibility to specific Index Coop contributors with expertise in managing on-chain indices. This proposal seeks to create an IMC to assume responsibility for this role.</p>
<h1>
<a name=""specification-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#specification-3""></a>Specification</h1>
<h3>
<a name=""overview-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#overview-4""></a>Overview</h3>
<p>The IMC will be responsible for updating and maintaining the methodologies for the following products:</p>
<ul>
<li>icETH</li>
<li>dsETH</li>
<li>MVI</li>
</ul>
<p>Any future Index Coop products that launch without a third-party methodologist will also come under the purview of the IMC. In the event that Index Coop agrees to join in partnership with a third-party who will assume the Methodologist role for any or all of these products, these responsibilities can be revoked by IIP.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""structure-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#structure-5""></a>Structure</h3>
<p>The IMC will consist of three members with expertise in on-chain indices, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class=""mention"" href=""/u/afromac"">@afromac</a></li>
<li><a class=""mention"" href=""/u/mrmadila"">@mrmadila</a></li>
<li><a class=""mention"" href=""/u/sidhemraj"">@sidhemraj</a></li>
</ul>
<p>IMC members will serve until they are removed by an IIP or voluntarily step down. Additional members can be added or removed by IIP. IMC members will not be additionally compensated as they will be core contributors to the Index Coop DAO.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""responsibilities-6"" class=""anchor"" href=""#responsibilities-6""></a>Responsibilities</h3>
<p>The IMC will be responsible for ensuring that product methodologies are fair and objective and that they represent the best possible version of the strategy that Index Coop can execute with the current resources and information available. This will be achieved by defining clear and quantifiable rules and criteria and removing any ambiguous language that might exist in the methodologies today.</p>
<p><strong>Updating Methodologies</strong></p>
<p>Over time, product methodologies should be updated when new technology and information becomes available. Any changes to a product methodology should be clearly communicated to the wider community, along with the rationale for the changes. A product methodology should only be updated infrequently to ensure consistency for token holders.</p>
<p>The IMC will regularly review existing methodologies to determine if any changes or updates are necessary. This formal review will occur bi-annually, and informal discussions will continue throughout the year to keep the methodologies up to date. If a change is proposed, one of the IMC members must publish the proposed change on the forums. The committee, consisting of three members, will use optimistic governance, which means that any communication from a committee member will be considered to have been unanimously agreed upon unless objected to on the forum by the two other members. In the event of a dispute, changes can be resolved via an IIP</p>
<p><strong>Executing Rebalances</strong></p>
<p>The IMC will also ensure the highest standards in data collection, methodology execution, and communication around product rebalancing and reweighting. Data should be collected from multiple trusted data providers to ensure accuracy. The raw data should also be made available in the Pre-Rebalance Report to protect against data manipulation, errors, and corruption.</p>
<p>All intended rebalance trades should be communicated in advance to token holders, and all trades to execute the rebalance should prioritize capital preservation as the primary goal.</p>
<p>Specific milestones and documentation to be published during the rebalance period includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Collection: To occur 10 days before a rebalance</li>
<li>Pre-Rebalance Report: To be posted 1 week before a rebalance</li>
<li>Rebalance Date: To begin on the first working day of the month in line with the specific schedule of the product methodology</li>
<li>Post-Rebalance Report Date: To be posted within 3 working days of the completion of the rebalance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Criteria for Membership</strong></p>
<p>All candidates for inclusion in the IMC now or in the future should have previous experience in designing and operating on-chain financial products. It is highly recommended that they are recruited from the product team directly, as is the case for this initially proposed cohort.</p>
<p>Specific competencies include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Risk management</li>
<li>On-chain liquidity evaluation</li>
<li>Financial data analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-compliant members can be asked to stand down by the Operations Pod, and be replaced by IIP.</p>
