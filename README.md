# Collective DAO Archive Catalog
The Collective DAO Archive Catalog is a comprehensive, living open source resource that captures, indexes, and archives various challenges and events from existing DAOs. Together, as an open source database that anyone can contribute to, we can use the power of collective intelligence to highlight patterns and improve the development of new and existing DAOs.
