# daocollective.archives
The DAO Collective Archive is a comprehensive, living open source resource that captures and categorizes various challenges and solutions from existing DAOs. Together, as an open source database that anyone can contribute to, we can use the power of collective intelligence to highlight patterns and improve the development of new and existing DAOs.
