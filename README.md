# DAO Collective Archives
The DAO Collective Archive is a comprehensive, living open source resource that captures and categorizes various challenges and solutions from existing DAOs. Together, as an open source database that anyone can contribute to, we can use the power of collective intelligence to highlight patterns and improve the development of new and existing DAOs.

## Who It's For
1. 👷🏻‍♀️ **DAO Builders**: This resource helps people building DAOs/orgs by providing insights into commonly used practices that can be used as guidance for creating effective roadmaps.
2. 🛠 **DAO Tooling / Service Providers**: This resource offers deeper insight and contextualizes the consistent challenges of DAOs, shedding light on unmet needs and opportunities for improvement.
4. 📚 **Content Creators**: This resource engages content creators who are interested in contributing or expanding on topics related to DAOs.
